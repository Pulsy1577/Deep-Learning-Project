This is a repository for a school project during Spring semester 2023. This project was on Deep learning for sentiment analysis using BERT.
This code will take in data, process it and split it, tokenize it, import a model, test the model on a testing set, then train the model and test it again after training.
The jupyter notebook file BertFinal will run as is in order, if all requirements are installed.
There is also a T_5_Test file, this was for initial testing, the file is not completely finished, but provides a good example of how to impliment a T-5 model for sentiment analysis

The data is hosted on kaggle, however an updated version with better column headers is located within this repository.
To load your own data simply follow the comments in the file.
