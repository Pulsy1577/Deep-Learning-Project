There is weird visual bugs everywhere, NPCs T posing, lighting issues, cut scene lighting flickering. Crashing is a pretty big issue as well.

Companies do not care about the consumer as they know people will buy the game anyway. It\\'s almost like common practice now to throw terrible ports or poorly optimized games at PC players. They throw these games out there like a fresh pile of sh*t, then clean them up later (Like Cyberpunk 2077). I\\'d like to know why they had to push back the original release date because they obviously didn\\'t use that time to optimize this hot garbage. The game isn\\'t entirely unplayable for me, but I do have some terrible stuttering once and a while. But that is just for me; many players have the same, if not worse, issues than I do. It seems like the \"day one patch\" hasn\\'t done anything to address any of the problems either (if it was even our day one patch as it was only 300mb for me). I will leave this review negative until they fix the performance issues. Also, another point/conjecture is that the game runs fine in the beginning, almost like they just optimized that part so that you hit your 2-hour playtime and can\\'t refund the game after you realize how terrible the game runs later. Very scummy, if true, but I digress; if you can\\'t wait for the game to get optimized and want to play now, go ahead. As I said, I like the game; but I am sick of PC players getting sh*t on.Also, if you want to know, here are my PC specs (at least what I think is relevant):CPU: Intel i5-12600kGPU: ASUS TUF RTX 3080 Ti OC EditionRam: Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB (2 X 16GB) DDR4 3600I use/run the game on a 1440p 144hz monitor. I kept the games resolution at 2560x1440 but capped this game at 75 fps to reduce stuttering when frames drop. (I sometimes dip into the 60s or lower). Still get pretty bad stutter here and there.Settings I toyed with to get a better frame rate:Running the game on a mixture of high and ultra settings.DLSS: BalancedRay tracing is all off - I\\'d suggest you turn that sh*t off if you are having issues as it was what killed my frames.V-sync: Off in-game but turned on with Nvidia control panel.Low latency: on+boost'], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Finally, I can live the dream of being a wizard like Harry Potter did in the Harry Potter movies that are about Harry Potter being a cool wizard doing cool wizardy things'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': [\"sst2 sentence: Solid fun, ignore all the Media Bullshit and just play the game, you'll enjoy the hell out of it like me.\"], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: its an amazing game!!!'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: LEVIOSAAAAAAAAAAAAA'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Really makes you feel like Spiderman.'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': [\"sst2 sentence: It's been a while i had a game get my attention this much during the prologue.

Without DLSS tech it would be unplayable even on low and I hardly ever use DLSS because of quality loss (it is ok mostly, but there are some graphical bugs and blurriness).First 1.5h showed me fights that consists of 2 buttons, attac and defense/counter. Maybe it gets better later but I won't risk it for not getting refound. Overall fight feels not smooth at all, it is definetly far from elden ring / witcher smoothnes.Castle has mostly run and find something quests. You can find a lot of hidden scrolls everywhere and that is basicly it. At least in first 1.5h of a game (and i rushed a lot to get as far as I could), maybe it gets better later but I was just bored of no skips/no sprint being forced too often.I guess Hogwarts fans can't complain, it is the best that was made to this date.For now it seems like hype went too far and the fact that there is not much bugs on realease and it is not a standard now so it is a huge pro for a game.

Looks nice, but aside from the Harry Potter theme there really isn't anything new. Lots of fetch this and do this quests just like any other RPG before it, but locked in a smaller world. Would I recommend this game now for the price, NO. Pros: Nice Graphics and on Ultra no issues so far, which for a AAA game on release makes a nice change. If you’re a Harry Potter fan or a RPG fan in general it’s a solid game and does offer a nice open world to explore.Use of magic and having to attend classes to learn new spells is good and adds a nice level of immersion and teaches the basics. Cons: Enemy variety is poor but given that they are trying to stay true to the source material it can be forgiven.Lack of camera control while on your broom or creature is poor, not being able to pan the camera in a full 360” in a modern game just feels lazy.Not being able to select the amount of items to buy/sell is a poor design choice, also the shop layout and overview is poor. Lockpick mini game is terrible. (You’re meant to be a wizard/witch) having to play the P*ss poor lockpick game is annoying and takes away from the fact you have magic powers and should just be able to open the lock. Having the choice in character menu to choose what style/colour of outfit (purely cosmetic) you would like to pick is nice but wasted as any item of clothing you pick that has better stats defaults to original design and you have to go and select the cosmetic look again. Not being able to rotate the map a full 360.Not having a choice for read all on the inventory/item/information screen is annoying. Hopefully within the next few weeks/months the developers will sort out the small things like this. Having places/castles that you can't fly over even though they unlock later is an odd choice(have them open to fly over just don't spawn the mission/quest) again it's an in game choice by developers that takes away from the feel of the open world\"], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: A dream come true!!'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: hrry pottuh'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: amazing game'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: This game is great on all levels....the battles and magic abilities look great, the open world looks beautiful, and most importantly the game is fun overall.'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Great cut scenes and detail.

Horrible optimization. Between every fast travel, it takes AGES to load. Just walking from one area to the next freezes the game. They can\\'t even make the game correctly, during one of the side quest puzzles the blocks completely glitched out and the game needed a restart in order for the blocks to spawn correctly(Herodiana puzzle). Most of the Merlin puzzles are straightforward, and other times you spend 10 minutes looking for one ball because they decided to put it really really far away. Not to mention how some Merlin puzzles didn\\'t even make sense until someone explained to me that I had to find hard to see ass butterflies/moths and lead them w the light to their resting place. Sometimes(rarely) moonstone spawns inside the terrain. The timed race courses are pretty bad, hit every bubble and you still get 2nd place. Enemies(trolls) sometimes decide to teleport from one place to another when attacking when usually they don\\'t, like the game thinking that the enemy should be able to hit despite you were already far away and so it teleports the model over. Once you get the broom most parkour is useless in areas you can fly. Finding the pages strewn around the map is pretty good but is hell when the game hardly takes into account for elevation between you and said page when it \"rings\", you can find yourself going in a completely different direction for like 2 minutes before realising that it\\'s a dead end and having to go all the way back down. When you try and open the special items inventory there\\'s a chance that you end up using whatever item you had equipped especially when you try and get on a mount(why isn\\'t there a button keybinded to summon the mount?). Overall? I feel like they just decided to squeeze money out of die-hard HP fans especially since it\\'s 50~ standard and 60~ deluxe. You can buy older(and much cheaper) open-world games that just are in every way better. When not horribly dying the game is pretty good. Although it feels too hand holdy in some areas and in other areas I feel like they completely dropped the player to figure out shit by themselves without any sort of support. In both cases, it can become very frustrating very fast. Butterflies sometimes just don\\'t work(follow the butterflies but the butterflies never reveal the chest they just circle the spot). Sometimes enemies don\\'t even spawn in camps and when you enter it automatically completes the camp. One spends ages running around collecting the demiguise moons and when you get an upgrade the mini-game for unlocking stuff doesn\\'t even change just the same thing over and over. I\\'ve had two different story quests soft locked due to horrible AI pathing. I hate how I have to mark a quest, and exit the menu back onto the game before it registers that there\\'s a new path and actually marks it out before I can figure out where I need to fast travel on the map. Bone puzzles are annoying all the time, either the right things don\\'t spawn or the bones just won\\'t go in. There\\'s an NPC that\\'s well known not to load in their skin and is usually just hair and clothes, it\\'s been days since the game launched from when I\\'m writing this specific note and it\\'s yet to be fixed. I\\'ve seen my friend\\'s game bug out so badly that every leafy thing in his render distance is bugging out and moving crazy. Half the time when you get a mask customisation the MC\\'s cheeks end up glitching through it during cutscenes. There are so many Merlin\\'s trials that it\\'s a pain to get them all and after you\\'ve gotten all the upgrades from getting them there are still so many left to collect and you get no reward for doing so(they get hella repetitive very quickly). I swear whoever wrote these quests can\\'t write a single goddamn happy ending for anything, the only time it\\'s above 90% guaranteed that things will turn out well are when animals are included, otherwise, there are so many goddamn side quests and main quests that characters are just killed willy nilly, don\\'t get attached to any character you never know when they gonna get whacked even if you feel like the MC could\\'ve done something. Some level designers are clearly much better than others especially when it comes to some places that are quite hellish to get through especially when they dont have any hints placed even not with Revelio. WHO WROTE THIS STUFF, 100% of the time when an NPC uses an unforgettable curse during a cut scene to save someone they could\\'ve just used an expelliamus instead. I hate how you can throw around the curses willy nilly without any problems and when one character (One slytherin boio)uses it in front of others they immediately get the boot despite my ass having the curses always on cd literally the fight before the cut scene. My friend got hard locked out of getting an achievement because one of the infamous foes he killed refused to be counted, and they don\\'t respawn. Another friend somehow killed Professor Fig(via goblins)and respawned and he dropped a [DEV_PLACEHOLDERREWARD]. I\\'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS ONE FUCKING EXPLORATION CONJURATION FOR LIKE 4 FUCKING HOURS NOW. HOLY FUCK.

But you know nothing about making games. That\\'s what makes this game a 5/10 for me. Great ideas, bad execution.This game is designed so awfully that I cannot put things in words. It\\'s like the devs never played an actual RPG game. - No skippable dialogues. I DON\\'T WANT TO HEAR THE OLD LADY TALK FOR 2 MINUTES ABOUT HER FLOWERS (and yea, I clicked to listen it again, big mistake. I was about to punch something)- Menus are confusing- The game explains you basically nothing (for example how to change the appearance of gear or put the hoodie on)- Bugs BUgs BUGS! So many bugs! Students sitting backwards, T-posing or appearing only after you land is normal- COMBAT BUGS IN AN RPG? Sometimes the game just decides that you cannot select an enemy and you WILL shoot at nothing. Smaller the space to combat, worse it becomes. In Hard mode it\\'s impossible to duel for that reason, but in the open world fights are enjoyable.- STORY. Man it feels like an Isekai anime. You\\'re op, everyone knows you and you know everything. There\\'s literally no thing you cannot do worse than others. And also very predictable. - 1 maybe 2 likeable characters. Sebastian likeable, but a little dickhead. Nelly is just bland boring. Poppy has some interesting quests... And the ravenclaw guy? Who even remembers his name at this point? Man, my fav is Ominis, which ISN\\'T EVEN A COMPANION- Not historically accourate. Not a single bit. (Not to be racist, but where do all these race variety comes from in 1800? I mean, in these times not only House Elfs were bought)- Fps drops / poorly optimised for it\\'s content (look at RDR2, which came out in 2018)- Open world locations are easily forgettable- I didn\\'t find ANYWHERE a photo mode. What RPG game doesn\\'t have a fucking photo mode in 2023?)- Mounts are useless. More difficult to control and slower than a broom- People will forget you after 5 seconds. \"Oh thank you! You rescued my son!\" *you exit and reenter the house* \"HMMM I tHinK I knOw YoU. WERE YOU THE STUDENT THAT SAVED MY SON??\"- What even are these cloth mechanics. Just look at the skirt+broom combo. Or jump a lot with the school cloak.- Jumping? So you tell me I can jump over a castle wall, but cannot leap a kneecap-tall wall at Hogsmeade? Or cannot exit the river if the rock is at my ankles?[b]Well, pros:[/b]- Great game for potterheads, just like myself- Stunning visuals- Story overall is enjoyable and has 1 or 2 twists- Nice combat mechanics- Super big open world- World feels alive, something\\'s always happening on screenI want to love this game so much, I waited for it for 2 years constantly checking when it will be out. But it\\'s clearly a Cyberpunk situation. Fix it or let it be made fun of (as it is constantly) by people who bought this game because it\\'s a game. Not because it\\'s Harry Potter Universe.

Really do buy it.So why am I voting it negative?Because for some reason the developers have not only gone out of their way to disproportionately over represent as many minority groups as possible (which isn't a huge issue), but they've also removed all options for lighter skin tones from the character creator. You could brush this off as a lazy oversight, but with the developers going to such lengths to try and include all minority groups, and fact that there are plenty of NPCs with pale skin, this can only mean that this was a deliberate choice on their part, which given the controversy surrounding this game strongly suggests that it was done out of spite.It's ironic because the people that the developers are trying to please are the ones crying out to boycott the game, and the other 99% of customers are the ones that the developers are disrespecting.Cultural diversity is like cooking.Dishes (cultures) are great on their own or as part of their cuisine, because apart from everything else that can show what makes them amazing.Inclusivity is where you start trying to mix them together. It doesn't work, turns out disgusting, and ruins all of the original dishes in the process.If I want Africa, I want to go to Africa and see how wonderful it truly is.If I want India, I want to go to India and see how wonderful it truly is.If I want Britain, I want to go to Britain and see how wonderful it truly is.I DON'T WANT THEM MIXED INTO A SINGLE SOUP THAT RUINS ALL OF THEM AT ONCE.I love exploring other cultures, and love people from other cultures, but I'm very concerned that the efforts being made to mix them all together is going to ruin everything.It does feel though that the game was originally created with appropriate racial distribution, because many of the other cultural token characters feel like they inserted later on to fill their quota. I'm not sure if it's because of this, but the voice acting is a little rough in places.Mods have already started fixing most of the garbage inclusivity in the game (including the lack of lighter skin tones) and while I do maintain that this game is awesome, my review is staying negative because the developers need to learn that when creating content for an existing franchise, they need to respect and uphold the already established cultural identity, history, and integrity, because that's what the existing fan-base wants and expects. If the developers want to try something different, they should use a blank canvas instead of trying to leech off and disfigure someone else's work.Hoping some patching fixes the performance issues.I usually run most games at ultra then reduce the res a bit, but at the moment I'm forced to run it at medium, rtx off, and at a lower resolution.

There are so many details and you never stop finding secrets and unlocking cosmetics.

This results in stutter and light, objects, shadows and people popping in from nowhere. No detail in the world can take away the horrible optimization of every room change inside the castle.https://youtu.be/ozNdV0s5Du8In the open world the pop-in problem persists with lights, shadows and characters popping in from nowhere and the open world overall feels empty and boring with little to do other than the scripted puzzles, side-quests and enemies in scripted locations. The lack of random encounters of characters that could have given you any time consuming fun mini quest makes the (not so big) map feel empty, boring and just a shell. Where are the NPCs that need help in the dark forest? They seemingly walk there with no problem. Or the captured NPC’s from a base, anything. Literally anything to make the map feel more alive.I should also mention the very(!) repetitive voice lines during questing and exploring. There is one quest where there are five voice lines that keep repeating every time you do an action like looting a chest. It is very frustrating. It’s the same while exploring, NPC’s don’t really “talk”, they throw out a set of voice lines in a repetitive order and you don’t get that feeling that they are having an actual conversation. Same with enemies, same few voice lines over and over.And no, the map is not that big, it's big but I had hoped for more.https://youtu.be/KjM8brPxzrEBeautifully detailed castle and worldCan fly anywhere (almost) once flying is unlockedVoice acting on main story charactersTons of cosmeticsCan change gear appearance anytimeMusicVoice acting on the main character is boringPop-insStutterVERY repetitive voice lines during quests and exploringThe world don’t feel aliveLack of random encounters in a open worldIs it a great game for Harry Potter fans? Yes, yes it is. There are so many easter eggs, discoverables, characters etc. that every Harry Potter fan will spend most time in the castle exploring every nook and corner. Is it a great open world adventure game? No, this is where I would like to give a rating between thumb up and down. I choose the down thumb due to the lack of optimization, random encounters, and how fast the game becomes repetitive and you find yourself doing the same thing over and over except for the main story line.I probably missed a ton of things I've thought about during my game-play but this is what is stuck in my head every time I play it.It's a game I will finish but I won't bother doing more than that.\"], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: You will never be a real wizard.

Not to mention the unoptimizable port to PC. The game (so far) is also quite linear despite its open world aspects. For a game that touts that dialogue choices do matter (which should always be taken with a grain of salt) I haven’t seen a noticeable difference between my SO’s play through as well as mine. NPC dialogue animations are awful. I’d say, akin to those of ESO: Oblivion. The eyes and mouth seem to have lives of their own, and the lip sync isn’t all that great. For a big IP like Harry Potter the game feels like a 2010 remaster rather than an actual, current-gen game. I’ve just unlocked the room of requirements. I don’t know how far along I am, but the story is quite alright. If the game gets better I’m open to giving it a better score, but in its current state I’d give this game 3/5 stars. I’m enjoying it, but I’m not thoroughly enjoying it enough to give it another star, and the other star is missing for the missing QOL improvements.Just my take on the game so far, at full price after the day one patch. Although I do agree that games can and should pitch the game later on, I do think that optimization and basic UX improvements should come when the game is first released rather than months later.TL;DR:- NPCS are just decoration. Absolutely no interaction with them whatsoever.- Eyes and mouths have a life of their own during dialogue animations- Story is alright- Poorly optimized PC port. Unreliable and seems to have memory leaks in its coding which fill up RAM.- A lot of cut corners.    - No Quidditch   - Dorms are available to roam around in, but nobody uses them. No option to sleep in your own bed.   - No night-time prefects mechanics. You can also roam around freely in the library's restricted section but good luck finding anything as nothing is interactive (goes for the majority of things in the game)   - Animations are extremely dated   - Controller customization is non-existent. Flying feels clunky and unintuitive   - General must-have QOL improvements expected of a $60 game are missing- The game is extremely linear. Not just in terms of story, but even in terms of player movement and general experience.For $60 I would've expected a polished product as soon as it's released. If you're expecting interactivity with NPCs similar to the likes of Red Dead Redemption or engaging side stories with proper consequences and player freedom like in Skyrim, this is the wrong game. I'd only purchase it for the story, and if that's all you're interested in, I'd wait until it's on sale.Edit: Formatting.\"], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Absolutely love it.'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Literally a dream come true!

Now it won\\'t get past the shader prep screen, just a black screen. I can see it\\'s working in taskmanager but even when it finishes the game stays on the black screen. I just spent an hour troubleshooting and trying all the common fixes, nothing is working for me. Nice waste of $$ I guess...**ORIGINAL REVIEW**I am really loving this game so far. Combat is amazing, one of the most fun combat systems I\\'ve ever played. I usually play on \\'easy mode\\' when it\\'s my first playthrough of a story heavy game but combat is so much fun in Hogwarts Legacy that I\\'ve been playing at a higher difficulty level and I\\'m enjoying the extra challenge. The open-world is full of stuff to do and explore. There\\'s so much happening all over the place it really feels alive. Soundtrack and sound design in general is incredible, some of the best I\\'ve ever heard. This is truly an incredible experience. I\\'m still early in the game(was gonna wait till I finished to write a review but it\\'s just too good), but this has the potential to become one of my top five games, definitely top ten.Minor spoilers about the Room of Requirement, [spoiler] it is the coolest fucking thing ever. I love how they implemented it as like your own private base of operations and place to study. The customisation system is super easy to use and you can do a lot to make the space your own. I can see myself spending hours there. [/spoiler]Regarding the complaints about \"wokeness\" there is a difference between \"wokeness\" and representation. The Trans bartender is perfectly fine, they never even draw attention to the fact or mention that she is Trans specifically. At least not from what I\\'ve seen. You can just pretend she has an unusually deep voice or that she\\'s a heavy smoker if it bothers you that much. I honestly can\\'t wait to see more of her, the first scene of her in the game establishes her as an absolute badass, who has your back but it\\'s not done in any kind of annoying or \"woke\" way, the fact that she\\'s Trans is just a small part of her larger character.My biggest complaint with the game is that it was designed primarily with a controller in mind and with PC controls are a bit of an afterthought. Overall it plays well but being limited to four spell slots is obviously a controller decision and there\\'s no reason why we can\\'t have more on PC. You can scroll between sets and have up to 16 spell slots buts it\\'s kinda clunky scrolling between the sets of 4 rather than just having a full numerical toolbar with 10 slots or even 12 if you include - and =. Four spells at a time is not enough. So I think the UI for PC could be better. Why should k&m controls be limited because the game was designed for consoles?Similar to how Mass Effect did it would be perfect. You have a limited number of abilities you can bind to controller buttons and the rest you can use or swap-out in the ability wheel. When using k&m the ui changes to show a tool bar with all your abilities bound to the numerical keys, removing the need to bring up the ability wheel. Speaking of limiting PC features it\\'s ridiculous that this game has DualSense support on PlayStation but not on PC. Plenty of games, both from Sony and 3rd-party studios are releasing with DualSense support on PC so why is it a PlayStation exclusive feature for this title? Same with the PlayStation exclusive quest. This kinda shit sucks. But other than that the game is amazing, I\\'m having so much fun.'], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: i am the one who sets innocent students going about their day on fire'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: I only have about 11 hours in the game so far, but it has been absolutely amazing!'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Revelio Simulator is a pretty nice game, appeases my loot goblin habits.'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Best game in like the past 10 years hands down!'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence:  I am 25 hours in 23% complete, first play threw.

At some point you will start avoiding locked doors to save yourself from the Alohomora minigame which is absolutely the same for the 50th time.It tries to be an RPG, but the open world is dead, character progression is rudimentary, the story is on rails, your choice has no consequences and possibilities for roleplaying are nonexistent since the game forces being a hero on you no matter what you do.When a game has interesting progression, different skills and builds to experiment with you can overlook the plot flaws. When a game has rich roleplay you can enjoy it even when the combat is garbage. When both aspects of the game are lacking, then you can at least have fun exploring an exciting world full of unique secrets and puzzles.But when all of those aspects are frustrating on their own, it leads to the game being frustrating as a whole. That\\'s the kind of disappointment I felt after a playthrough, and that\\'s likely what the OP felt too.So no, it\\'s not the case of wishing for this game to top Skyrim (not that it\\'s too much an ask in 2023), it\\'s the case of seeing a huge gorgeous decoration but only a minimal effort put to bring it all to life.

Paintings move, statues too, tons of collectibles and the sounds and visuals are outstanding. All that being said, I still don\\'t really recommend this game for the average player. Big time HP fans will enjoy this experience yes, but people who have seen and enjoyed the movies but that\\'s it? You won\\'t get alot of excitement out of this. The combat is a little clunky and confusing. As someone who uses a controller, the attack button schemes criss-cross in a weird way that more often than not, cause me to fumble what I\\'m doing and miscast, it just isn\\'t a good flow and it needs to be said. The rest of combat is entirely this: spam 4 combo light attacks and mix in combo\\'d \"shield breaker\" spells like Levioso. The enemies occasionally attack in sporadic attacks that you see pop ups for countering, and countering everything consists of pressing Y to put up a temp shield bubble or rolling out of the way. That\\'s it. Haven\\'t played deeply enough so it may change up but I haven\\'t seen clashing spells of any type yet either which is a bummer.The gear, map and really just everything feels like some weird Multiplayer system for Destiny or similar types which, I mean, works but just is odd. I do love the customization you can do however and the player creation is great.I saved a whole section for this cause its atrocious: NPC\\'s are static. Yes you see them walking around and moving and doing stuff, some of the professors aren\\'t always in their classrooms for example. But its all a show. The best way to explain it is to again compare it to Destiny and its player hub in the Tower. Those NPCs move and fake being active but don\\'t actually do anything. Same thing here but its even worse, at night they all just simply vanish. Not a soul in the castle save here and there, not even in the house rooms or the beds. Gone. All of em just gone. Absolutely can\\'t let that slide, its lazy as hell for a game of this caliber. (Also I thought it was against the rules to wander at night? Are we not a student?)Flying is fun, pretty much it. Really wish Quidditch was there but its most likely gonna be sold to us in DLC so bleh.RPG elements are neat and so is the storytelling (save for the foreign exchange girl stating wandless magic is a common thing in Africa, when we explicitly know that isn\\'t an easy task, much less being just as powerful as using a wand) so I give em points for that, although you can\\'t actually be evil in this game save for the curses and being smart in your replies so that sucks. Pretty much more of a storytelling game on the scale of Life is Strange but you have free roam and Destiny multiplayer vibes everywhere. Seriously it feels like I should be sending an invite to my friends every time load up.All in all, I wish I could get my money back, because I\\'m going to have to force myself to play through this on an easier difficulty, combat just isn\\'t fun.Edit: I also have learned that Denuvo is the anti cheat system on this game and I absolutely refuse to allow that kind of kernal level access to anyone.

The whole game is about collecting and completing repetitive side quests. 2. NPCs like dummies that wonder from one place to another or just stand waiting for you to complete their tasks.3.  Class attendances end up with cut scenes that lasts lesser than 15 secs.4. No proper rewards for gathering collectibles. 5. There so many collectibles that seems there was no time for devs to add anything else. Only 13 magical beasts, 7 potions and 14 plants. Isn’t that too little for such a big world? 6. Some interactions were really simplified and limited.7. There is no back story about your character. No notes, letters, nothing. You are just a hero from the beginning. 8. The most ridiculous loot system I've ever seen. Most of them just break the atmosphere. You wont feel yorself as a student in all that strange clothes...you gonna look like a clown.9.

No doubt about it. However, I think for many people, it failed to live up to some simple expectations.The game is MISSING key aspects of an ideal Hogwarts experience that I would like to point out: ✘ No enforced curfew. (Useless day and night cycle, you cant even go to bed to skip the night, you simple press 'wait'.) ✘ Classes take about 2 mins (only a handful to attend,) and often only consist of a brief montage and boring dialogue. ✘ Too many shitty fetch quests. ✘ The magic of interacting with your classmates in dorms, over meals, between classes... doesn't exist. ✘ No Quidditch. ✘ Some of the worst NPC's I've ever experienced. ✘ Potion making was something I had looked forward to a lot, turns out its just a crafting bench with no real interactivity other than to select what you want, and wait for it to brew. ✘ General feeling of wasted potential, especially considering the release of this title will likely mean lack of a better, similarly inspired game being released in the near future.Performance seems to be a common complaint, although I experienced no issues:RTX 3060 Eagle OC 12gb16gb ddr4 Ram @ 3600mhz Intel i5-12400fWhat I loved: ✔ The map, especially Hogwarts itself, is beautiful.

So many glitches and strange story progression.Fourth, if you do not look at it as a \"harry potter\" thing, you can have fun. Really this is a dumbed down higher graphical version of the Half Blood prince--which has the correct length and design of the castle (for the most part).On it\\'s own, Howart\\'s Legacy is fun. It\\'s not immersive as you can\\'t interact with the characters/npc\\'s apart from just a few. Nobody really reacts to what you\\'re doing, I mean, (SPOILER ALERT) in the beginning you cast this ridiculous ancient magic that came out of nowhere that basically is a mini goku spirit bomb and nobody even talks about it, nobody is wowed by it, nobody cares. You can\\'t sit down at the dining hall and eat, nothing is interactable apart from a few books stacked in random places.I look forward to its progression, however, unless they allow mods, I don\\'t see this being improved on in the future--these developers lack imagination and they are not gamers but political activists pushing agendas that are clearly unpopular. Other than a few marshmallow sympathizers for the crybaby generation, nobody wanted that stuff in the game.I will finish this game despite not recommending it because I paid $70 so...'], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': [\"sst2 sentence: I'm a f*****g wizard too, Harry.\"], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': [\"sst2 sentence: it's reallly coool\"], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: YESI Enjoy itBAM BAM, Wizard JoshY'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: pretty good not the best rpg but i good game over all'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Finally, Some good fucking Game,Nvm The new patch fucked the game performance and now I can even open it'], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: amazing game'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Sometimes it seems all roads lead to hogsmeade'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: 10/10 - I pet a cat and then yeeted it across the room'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': [\"sst2 sentence: loved the game, it lived up to its expectations.

With tons of interruptions, given by damn and hopeless tips with information about what you have to do next, or what will happen now. You start your \"Hogwarts\" trip, already fighting with some creatures. wtf?And after the longest loading game I have ever, accompanied by a theatrical cinematic soundtrack, you are still so excited about your \"next big journey\", but you realize you are in a classic scripted game where you have: \"hit this key to do what we want you\\'ll do\", and \"do this and read this text to understand what we want you to do\"...I\\'m so shocked.

The classes. So far i did the first two classes and both where major disapointments.Both went with a short intruduction by the teacher, you showing off your prowness (being as good or better then all the others) , then show off some more and thats it.No actual lecture, no seeing other studends suceed or fail, no repraints for students not listeing.3. meetings without dialog. I have seen serveral cases already where a group of studends stand in a circle seemingly to converse.But being next to them you get no sound.There are cases where there is sound but in both cases they dont react to you.4.Reaction to the player.No studend seems to react to you unless you F (interact) with them. (If you even can do that)Bump into someone? They dont react in any way.5. House points.The teachers like you (offcourse they do) and so far everyone has given me house points.How many? No idea they dont say, there is also no mechanic for how many house points everyone has.I think there is no counter for house points and the entire thing is just there to make you the Main character look even better.6.) No moral You can do whatever you want, you will never get expelled by the shool. Hell there is no consequence for any rule breaking.7. Forced diversity.The game doesnt take long to make sure you notice how diverese the world is by introducing someone from africa.While i am not so far quest wise i know they will introduce a lesbian and a trans and make sure to mention that.Why are real live politics in the game. Forced diversity is never good and a reason why so many hate netflix.8. who are you?Do you have a family? friends? Where did you come from?Doesnt matter, you are the chosen one, stop thinking to much and just follow the quest marker.All in all a great disapointment. while there is no doubt much more to come, having so many flaws within the first 2 hours just doesnt make me want to keep playing.I am torn between playing this out of boredoom or refunding it and buying it later when its on a sale.A couple days of sleep should help with that decionEDIT:I just found out that most students disapear during the night.All the beds in the dorm are empty.They could have at least show them as sleeping but this checks out with the NPCs beeing half backed and not truelly lifelike,'], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: LOVE the game!!!!'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Magic WOOHOO'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: OMG - 2hrs of exploring the castle and still didnt see it all!The level of detail and originality in the castle design is AMAZING!Get it NOW!!!(From a person who has never pre-ordered)'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: The detail, story, and gameplay are fantastic.

The story is linear, you have no actual choice in anything, the graphics suck, it\\'s glitchy, it\\'s not as immersive as it should be due to all these things, and it\\'s dialogue is childish. If you disagree, I\\'d recommend not reading any further. This overwhelmingly positive review simping for this game needs to stop. Even from a first time dev team it\\'s a shame and has ubisoft vibes. That\\'s not good guys! Not to mention, this whole \"dlc\" talk now is just another way for devs to release incomplete games! It should not be acceptable. By the time, if these guys ever do, figure this out nobody will care about this game anymore. In 6 months the gameplay will be totally pointless. You can only do so much in this game. And I say this having enjoyed the \"magical world of Harry Potter\" so much from the books and movies. It\\'s just not implemented well in the game. It\\'s not lived in, NPC\\'s just exist in it and they are straight up cringe. Flying around feels sluggish and provides zero immersion after the first time you do it - which btw has to wait until quest 16! Yea, quest 16 is when you learn to fly. There are multiple missions before that you walk around like an idiot so the game can show you small portions of the map - and that is a cheap way of doing it. Instead of advancing to certain locations, they just go \"oh, lets run over here and pass this while I give you a tour guide like vibe, btw... I\\'m so friendly!\". So instead of making actual good gameplay they made up a crappy story to be a 5th year with no experience in anything around a bunch of students that somehow all get along from different houses. That\\'s why you can\\'t play quidditch - they wouldn\\'t even know where to begin on making it playable. I mean... c\\'mon. This is a GOTY contender? Literally the only thing it has going for it is a relationship to Hogwarts and Harry Potter. If it was ANY other game, it would have gotten massively slammed... but since most people who worship that stuff are incredibly childish and naive, they enjoy these \"quests\" and mindless puzzles with repetitive gameplay that brings nothing new to the table. Such a waste. And I completely ignored the controversy because I don\\'t care one single bit about any of that crap - I just want a good game. I wouldn\\'t even pay $30 for this game and it\\'s ps3 graphics. And yep, I\\'m on PC with a 3090 ti / 11900k @ 3840x1600 and the frame drops, pop-ins, glitches and stutters are absolutely astonishing. When you can go from 144 fps in some spots and simply turn around then it drops to 60, there is a problem. And INB4 someone says \"your hardware is the issue\" - Nope! Done all the \"fixes\" and it runs better without them. You can\\'t blame hardware when it will run every single other game just fine. But majority of PC players already admit that. What they don\\'t admit is that it shouldn\\'t be happening. I am so tired of games being released in this state. It\\'s unacceptable and the fact that we let developers do it is why I never pre-order games. I broke my moral code with this one and did it anyways. Never again. Not even for GTA6 after this. I have zero faith in gaming anymore. This game is trash. Just had to vent about it.

This is very frustrating and unthinkable in 2023 to have a transmog system without transmog sets or separate cosmetic slots. Right now you have to manually set your transmog every time you equip new gear, which is basically every minute you explore.2. No support for Dual Sense PS5 controller, especially lack of support for Trackpad and Haptic Feedback. And I know this game has it on PS5 and I know these features work on games on Steam. So it's unacceptable to cut this feature on PC.3. Main character holds our hand too much in puzzles. In one specific main story quests there is a puzzle concernig portals and if we don't get through one of these within 2 seconds (because we got open a chest like every rpg player would), the main character will explain how to solve the puzzle. And will keep talking about it until we go through. I get it, you want everybody to clear the game, but that should be the point of easier difficulties. Let us make mistakes and think for ourselves.4. Textures tend to glitch momentarily after teleporting. Extreme version of this is game flashbanging me with white screen when I teleport before it loads textures. It doesn't happen all the time, but often enough to be an issue (max quality, 4k, rtx, hdr)5. I gathered 122 out of 150 field pages in Hogwarts. It pains me that there is no reason to gather them now, because I don't get xp for them. Why are there so many? Let us have reason (in-game challenge) to gather all of them!6. Room of Requirement timers not running when we have menu opened. So we have this option to brew potions, grow herbs etc. and they all have timers like 10 minutes or so.

You might hear the (but it also releases at the some time on PC so it's 72) while players on other consoles have been enjoying the game 19 hours earlier.Preload was made available the same day the Early Access started, meanwhile guess what, ON CONSOLE (again) it was available to preload with days in advance.Day 1 patch will only deploy when the game releases, meanwhile any type of problem in the Early Access period that could be potentially solved is delayed and players are left with a bad experience.

Thank you JK Rowling, very cool.'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Hogwarts Legacy is a game built in a similar vein to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. It is an Action RPG where the action carries and the attention to detail in certain story beats leaves players looking forward to more. However, the RPG gameplay systems might as well not even exist as they are extremely lacking.Right out it should be said that the PC Port has a large number of performance optimisation issues. StoryStructurally anyone who has played DA:O will feel that this is very familiar. Go gather a few things in order to fight the big baddy. and after each thing is done you unlock new side missions and open up new systems and areas.I found the Secondary Characters to have very limited roles and to be largely forgettable. However, by and large the voice acting was on point. However, something that will bother a lot of players will be the forced diversity of the teaching cast. For 1880-1890 it is very diverse and racially stereotypical. With a Native teaching magical beast, an Indian and African teaching Divination and astrology. A Korean man randomly as the caretaker. With little effort being put into showing any historical accuracy. A personal nit-pick is the rail-line, with an isolated backwards largely insular society would have the Hogwarts express. Nevermind, how I am pretty sure there wasn\\'t a rial line that went from London to the Scottish highlands before the turn of the century.On the RPG Side The quest are limited and repetitive. Repetitive side activities are mandatory due to the fact that they are the main method of gaining experience points, expanding your inventory space and unlocking certain spells. Levelling is handled through completing objectives known as \"Challenges\". The challenges are a problem. After you kill a certain enemy a certain amount of times, you gain nothing but the same drop from fighting them. Loot is terrible. The looting feels like a severe after thought. Every chest drops a piece of gear and occasionally a potion. Long dungeons can result in you gaining 15 - 20 pieces of loot if you try for completion, however, you base inventory is 20 slots and the challenge that you need to do to expand it is a chore.Spell slots Spell slots are the way you interact with the world. However they are limited. And all your secondary \"spells or actions\" need to be slotted, there is no slot for non combat spells, resulting in a need to constantly micromanage them.CombatCombat is fun, it allows for multiple play styles with intuitive damage chains and hidden combos. By far combat is what carries Hogwarts Legacy.ConclusionThis was build with the casual in mind, from a core gamer perspective a lot is missing. I look forward to seeing how they decide to support the game post launch. My recommendation is wait for a sale.

The stutters are a nightmare, and really ruin the experience. A memory leak, GPU memory management issues, under utilization of resources and examples of what you may encounter playing this game right now. DLSS simply does not work properly, and the game runs like a slide show with any DLSS setting I try. FSR2 runs better than DLSS, and I'm running on a 2080 Super - that makes no sense.The voice acting is probably the second worst aspect of the game. They hired really poor voice actors for anyone but the teachers really, and I couldn't help but laugh at a couple performances.The male protagonist is doing his best Harry Potter impression (unfortunately the one from the first film) with about as much enthusiasm as a petrified tree stump. The female protagonist's VA struggles to enunciate, so I keep thinking she's three years in age rather than nearly eighteen years old. Why they were directed this way I'll never know.The voice pitch changer on the character creator may as well not be there - it renders the lower or higher pitched voices so robotic that you'd be better off getting Hatsune Miku to do the voice acting instead.The game feels a bit hollow, despite having so much to do. The aesthetic does come together really well, but there are so many rushed aspects to it, and the really awful performance on a 2080 Super, R5 5600x, NVME and 16gb RAM just makes me lose respect for the developer and publisher both for treating their community, once again, like beta testers.There are a couple bugs, such as loot getting stuck in a container if you try take it whilst overburdened (full on gear slots), or puzzle-related objects that you can interact with doing really really weird stuff and just despawning randomly. I've seen characters glitching through floors, the dreaded T pose amongst NPCs, NPCs spawning into existence in an instant in front of me, or resources spawning inside of objects instead of on the terrain correctly. The UI has some major oversights, so hopefully they actively look to improve that in the future. Not being able to pause whilst in cutscenes, or having to hold so long to sell stuff, or not knowing which OWL post letter you've yet to open, as they're not sorted in any logical way and don't show that they've been read, so you often ending up rereading the letters over and over to try find the one you missed.Come back in a month or two and see if they've fixed all the bugs and performance issues, and then maybe you'll have a better time than I did.

The castle feels pretty alive and and it has many of the environmental elements I would expect from Hogwarts. The environments/areas outside the castle are similarly polished.Unfortunately, such appearances only go skin deep. There is very limited interactivity with your environment outside of the scripted quests or the various treasure hunt type items. You can\\'t interact with any of the people that aren\\'t vendors or active in a given quest, can\\'t sit down in a chair or on a bench, no real commentary on player actions whatsoever. I have yet to feel drawn into the world as none of the characters are ever really present to engage with. I have no companions unless they are needed for a quest, there are no rivalries to be had (which is rather more noticeable as I went Slytherin) and that\\'s well before any of the immersion breaking progressive nonsense is added in. Short of it is, I don\\'t ever feel like a student at Hogwarts, I feel like a \"Mary Sue\\'d\" outsider partaking in a magical murder mystery theater.Speaking of quests, they are also \"meh\" for the most part. The main quest line is rather engaging and keeps you moving forward to find out what happens next, but the side quests are quite boring and often just boil down to your standard \"go fetch\" type quests. I have not found any side quest of substance as of yet.Combat is one of the saving graces so far. Generally quite intuitive and enjoyable. Presents a decent challenge while also making you feel like a spell slinging bad-ass on occasion.Oh, and the loot.  Seriously the loot system and types of loot is ridiculous.  The mechanics aren\\'t horrible, but the immersion break is.  My eyes ache from the rolling whenever, after traversing an \"ancient\" dungeon/crypt/cave, bypassing puzzles, slaying enemies, etc. I then spy an impressive looking chest, only to open said chest and be awarded with... a new scarf/house robe/glasses. -.-  Still have a ways to go in the game, so I\\'m gonna keep an open mind till I complete the game, but so far...

At first things were fine until I started to notice repeating performance issues. This game is beautiful, but not THAT beautiful; it should run fine on my system (System specs below) like most AAA titles do, but for some extremely frustrating reason, frame drops plague the game and completely ruin the experience. I have tried everything to make the game run better, spent at least two hours just making adjustments to my graphics settings, I used Nvidia optimization... didnt work, verified my files, etc. all to no avail. EVERYTHING else about the game so far has been enjoyable but when you are getting 70fps in a beautifully detailed intricate room and then you open a door to a classroom and it drops to 15fps for the next 5 minutes no matter where you venture from that point forward. Based on this, I've drawn the conclusion that the PC optimization is poorly facilitated in some manner, whether it be design or not. Its super disappointing when you are a HP fan and a decent $1200ish PC cant play a relatively non-demanding game. I do not know if maybe the games optimization is focused around newer Gen GPUs or if it is just poor across the board but atm, it has made the game unplayable for me especially considering how much I want ti fully experience tf game.

[/i]After having finished the game this morning, Hogwarts Legacy is no different from any Ubisoft game you have played in the last 15 years. The game is boggled with meaningless side quests, and the story is lackluster. With the Harry Potter IP, so much more could have been done. I am just disappointed.[h1] Character Creation [/h1]I do not understand who made the choice to remove any actual sort of customization to a game like this. You select character preset, and change their hair, eye color, etc. That's it. No ear shape, nose shape, jaw, nothing. Seeing as most other games offer that at the bare minimum, it's hard to see why they removed it. They lock it into a sense of realism, which is weird for a fantasy game. If I want green skin, I should be able to have green skin. [h1] Atmosphere [/h1]The main draw of the game, Hogwarts, is both a blessing and a curse. The animations of the stairs building, ghosts popping in and out, and the joyful music playing are probably the best parts of the game. That's all there is to it however, It just looks good. You cannot interact with any of the students. It's like an amusement park attraction. The only option is to walk around, observe, and eat an apple. The only other game I played set in an environment like this was Bully, and that game offered way more freedom than the developers here have allowed. It's hard to immerse yourself when you're pretty much watching a movie about your character, rather than actually playing as them.[h1] Main Story [/h1]The story is nothing special. It's not bad, but I was not excited to keep playing it. Can't say much else without spoiling.[h1] Side Content [/h1]I know I should not say the Witcher 3 side quests are the cream of the crop, as that is just overstated at this point, but it is what it is. I can't help to compare them to the cookie cutter ones we got here. Go collect 6 gobstoppers for this kid. Go find this obscure cliff from the mirror to find a chest with ugly glasses in it. Ubisoft-type missions and heavily prevalent. Side missions have no multiple endings, and they always end up predictable.[h1] Combat [/h1]In Hogwarts, you will get into plenty of scraps. a good ol' bout with some real scum. You will have to use your spells to blast your foes, so hopefully there's lots of them, right? Well, there's only [b] 26 [/b] spells. Yes, you hears that right, only [b] 26 [/b]. That's without even mentioning that you can only equip 4 spells at a time. They took the Mass Effect Andromeda route of limiting your combat for the sake of, i don't even know. With only 4 at a time, I felt extremely limited in what I could do. The animations themselves are great, but when looking at a game like Elden Ring, who has [b] 150 [/b] spells, and the game isn't only a wizard game, you realize that much more could have been done. Skyrim even has [b] 171 [/b] spells. And just like Elden Ring, that game has much more than just magic. Also, after comparing the difficulties between hard and normal, it is only a health bar difference. Enemies will damage you more, and you do less damage. Underwhelming if you ask me, when you could have had them use more strategy in taking you down.I know people won't like this, but Forspoken magic looks a lot better than this game. No one has actually played it, so no one has actually seen how good it looks.[h1] Exploration [/h1]This is by far the worst part of this game. Everything is locked behind a level based lock. most of Hogwarts Legacy is hidden behind locks that you must progress the story to unlock. You cannot explore at your own pace. I say it again, the developers choose when you get to have fun. It is a shame, as the world is beautiful. Riding the broomstick is amazing, I spent a lot of time just riding around. Mounts are great as well, love the threstral mount that I got from the deluxe edition.This one is a little nitpicky, but the doors feel weightless. Your character just pushes them open extremely fast, its honestly very jarring. The huge doors in the fountain area open effortlessly, which is extremely weird to me.[h1] XP Collection [/h1]This is the one thing that has left me completely confused. You only get XP by collecting lore scrolls around the map. WHY? No XP from defeating monsters, no growing stronger from your battles, you have to click left on the D-Pad, listen for a bell noise, and find a scroll to level up. I hate it. Don't forget the flying scrolls that you just grab out the air effortlessly.[h1] Conclusion [/h1] Hogwarts Legacy brings nothing new to the table. The graphics are the best part of the game, everything else is a either a weird gameplay decision, or a mechanic jacked from another game, yet done far worse. I would say this game is good of you love Harry Potter, and do not really play video games. Otherwise, this game is way overpriced for what it offers, and you may get bored easily once the initial honeymoon phase wears off around a few hours.\"], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: As a black guy, thank you for the freshest in game fade of the 22nd Century. #HouseHufflePuff'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: I catch myself smiling at something new at least 5 times an hour.'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: 10/10 game its brilliant'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: I find this game to be a lot of fun, kind of like being in a Harry Potter movie.'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: this is what 13-year old me imagined life at hogwarts would be. 10/10'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: 2 hours in, and the castle so far is everything i expected it to be and more.

Will add more to this review once I play more, so far I'm excited, but I'm keeping my expectations under control.Edit: The game is great fun, talents are nice and the more spells you unlock the better the game gets, unfortunely I will not give a positive on this one, not because the game is bad, but because the developers simply didn't care about the PC version, I'm running a 4090 and I get 40 and 60 FPS drops, even with medium graphics and DLSS, this is completely unacceptable for a modern title, specially one that doesn't justify this performance hit.It is important to point that if this wasn't a HP game it wouldn't even blip on people's radar, it is bland and shallow in many aspects, classes are just fillers, NPCs are fillers, the world is not alive.

There is no option to turn off the icon showing interactive items like chests etc. It is an immersion breaking thing as it often happens that the game tells you that you can for example interact with a hidden chest earlier than you were able to discover the chest on your own in the first place.2. There is no option to turn off the keyboard/gamepad buttons that are visible when you are standing nearby an interactive thing.3. Why does the game not respect players´ ability to solve puzzles? Why it must be that the character tells you hints just a few seconds after puzzles even begin? If you wanted to add such hints for impatience players, I am ok with that as long as I can turn them off.4.

The game transports players to a world filled with enchanting experiences, allowing them to enjoy the incredible feeling of being a student at Hogwarts. The game also offers a sense of control and power over events, with players able to choose which classes they want to attend and how they will navigate the world.However, while the game is very enjoyable and immersive, there are some flaws when it comes to the character creation and the inclusion of inclusive characters and trans characters like Sirona Ryan that don't fit with the lore. The character creation allows players to customize their character in a variety of ways, you even can make a male with female voice, hair and clothes, but the options are limited and the process is a bit cumbersome. Additionally, some of the characters that are included in the game are not consistent with the Harry Potter universe and feel out of place.Overall, Hogwarts Legacy is an incredibly magical and great game that offers a fantastic experience for anyone looking for a new way to explore the world of Harry Potter. Despite some flaws in the character creation and the inclusion of characters that don't fit with the lore, this game is still worth playing and will provide an enjoyable experience for any fan of the series.

Sure, you DO get to learn the unforgivable curses, (and that was my favorite side-story..you can even deny to learn them if you really want) but does it change much in the overall story? No, not at all. You can't be the precursor to Tom Riddle (lol) In fact, they seemed to have no effect on the final boss mechanically, though that was probably intentional. Without spoiling much, the final boss was far from normal.I enjoyed the 'main' student relationship-sidequests (and no, there are no romance options. I am not complaining, just letting you know). My personal favorite questline was the one with Poppy Sweeting from Hufflepuff.OH, and Quidditch is cancelled this year by the Headmaster! Haha...I couldn't believe it! Hopefully it gets added VERY soon.Anyway, yeah I would still rate this game a 6/10 due to the sheer fact that after the nostalgia, I feel the promise rings rather hollow. No quidditch.

Even people with 40 series cards have been having performance issues proving that the issue is less one's persona rig and more of yet another lackluster PC port by Warner Brothers and it's an outright travesty as the game itself is fantastic- and I would recommend it if it wasn't such a gamble to take on what your performance experience would be.

You see the same animation an hundred of time, there are not routine to people, they stand up straight until you get there.And the story is focalized on you, not allowing to fully characterize your classmates for example because they are all extra (and they won't be paid).In short, it's really sad and what boring are the fetch and collect quests (so many).\"], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: avada kedavra is my favorite pacification spell'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: AVADA KEDAVRA!'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: There is so much to do !

You are dropped in the game and you are immediately a super hero. I should also add you have absolutely no back story. At least when Rowling introduces us to the boy who lived it starts from the beginning and develops Harry prior to Hogwarts. Not only are you the immediate super hero, you start off as a 5th year student. Likely to do with the larger demographic of HP fans are in their 30s now and the studios thought it might not be appealing to play as an 11 year old but you still could come up with something... Such as starting off the game as a first year at 11, and that be the tutorial and as the tutorial is going along you\\'re quickly going through the years where you learn who it is that you are playing as and at the end of the tutorial is when you are beginning your 5th year. Instead they decided to just throw you in as an underdeveloped character beginning his first year as a 5th year as this already amazing wizard that the player did nothing to achieve that in game. Admittedly my suggestion is shallow at best too but it is still far more developing than what we got. Then to make it worse, when you\\'re going through your classes you\\'re constantly showered with \"Wow thats amazing, it took me years to figure that out\". Alas, the immediate super hero. Your character is also aware of who the main antagonist is and who his right hand man is, yet you, the actual player, has no idea. I mean who Ranrok is as a character. You personally have nothing to go off of. Lets talk about risk vs reward. There isn\\'t any. Early on during a quest you get a notification saying that you cannot wander the castle at night without risk of getting in trouble. Yet I do it every single night and literally no one stops you. There are several times where I have broken the rules and there is 0 tangible punishment. You help steal ingredients from the Potions Profs office. Then you get caught but thank god you made such a good potion and the professor just says \"Well I like people who take responsibility for their actions. You made a great potion today. That was no easy task\". Going back to showering the player with \"wow youre amazing\". Also I should add that you don\\'t actually do anything to make the potion. It is all done in what is essentially a cutscene. Another example of there being no punishment, when you learn how to fly you have the option to veer off course with a classmate and take the scenic route thus breaking the rules. You get caught, the prof says both of us will be penalized by taking a hefty amount of points away from your house and that should deter you from doing it again. THERE IS NO HOUSE CUP!! Therefore there was no punishment. Therefore no reason for me to taper my behavior. Also why the hell is there no house cup??? Wasn\\'t this game supposed to give you a feel for being a hogwarts student? AND ALSO why the hell is there no Quidditch?! You get sorted very early on and the headmaster, who is kind of a villian but you never interact with, says \"Due to an injury on the quidditch pitch there will be no quidditch season this year\". What injury?? The school year just started.. The students just arrived so how could there have been an injury. Why is there no quidditch?? Flying is in the game.. So is the Quidditch pitch. Outside the quidditch pitch, there are students in their quidditch house robes volleying bludgers around. You also find the snitch flying around in the room of requirement. Quidditch isnt even a complicated game. The assets are there. Put it in the game. Mark my words, Quidditch already exists within the game at launch and they will soon release Quidditch DLC and that DLC will just allow you to play it rather than adding it to the game. Similar to what EA did with Mass Effect did years ago.  Also in the main menu screen, the snitch sometimes flies around your head basically mocking you.Side objectives are mediocre at best. Its just mostly go collect this stuff or go kill these goblins and bring me my loot back. On the topic of quests in general, the game just points you exactly where to go which is odd in a game that is supposed to be immersive and open world. Rather it just holds your hand. There is one side mission that has you look for these objects that are usually high above you and even if it is not your specified objective if you enter a room and one is in there your character will tell you to look up in a very indirect but direct way.Then there is gearing.. Why in an HP universe game is there gearing?? Even then It also lacks depth. It honestly feels like an exploration device cause they could not come up with anything clever to entice you to explore more.The only real cool thing about the game is adventuring the school. However as a whole due to the fact of extremely shallow story narrative and very forced plot devices and no house cup and quidditch, I would strongly strongly advise that you do not purchase this game until they come out add features to it to make the game worth playing or it is on a massive sale'], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: I bought exactly 2 copies of the game.

I wanted the tediousness of going to class vie mini-games we get one mission about going to each class. The fighting system is nothing new in fact the entire game took systems from about a dozen other games and slammed them together. The few times they do add something new the player interacts with it once. This absolutely feels like Arkam the way you can jump off things, mixed with fable, but they leave out all the best part of either. For example Fable amazing NPC interaction and relationship systems. There is also Witcher vibes real hard especially in the way you use the spells. It doesnt do any of it great tho. You are all wearing rose colored glasses for this game because it Harry Potter. I almost feel for it to.Its an RPG in which your level does nothing but stand for an arbitrary boundary by which to restrict gear or quest. There are no skills, tags, feats, or abilities to combine with the spell system.So you unlock spells by doing this little mouse mini game with your cursor simulates moving the wand correctly. BUT YOU ONLY DO IT ONCE! I should do that for every spell and it be on a quick cast timer. Meaning, that I can only quick cast that spell until time runs out, at which point I have to recast using that mini game system. Atleast the player would see it more then a few times.... I dont want to do it every time but I want to interact with that system more then just once when I learn the spell. Harry Potter Hogwarts is dry it barley feels like you are at Hogwarts, the entire game should be one giant play ground and its not. This game should have evolved the industry instead its a weird Arkam, Dragon Age hybrid re-skinned thing made up to look like Harry Potter. They couldn\\'t even give us quidditch!!!We are three generation into video games the kids and adult who are playing this are way beyond the recycled game tropes delivered in Hogwarts Legacy. 8 year olds are modify Minecraft and using production/resource chain systems 100X more intricate then any game play system this game delivers.Honestly the game feel so detached from the universe and behind the times when concerning gameplay, that I have to question if a group of old executive types made it in a board room. No, it feel like a AAA studio who has failed to evolve in 20 years made this.Its really not much of an RPG either in fact it feels more like an on rails narrative akin to Arkam or Assassins Creed which are not RPGs. Those games have RPG elements but are not RPGs! Hogwarts has RPG elements but is not an RPG....Your actions will never impact the other students or the school outside of scripted events. THE ENTIRE GAME IS ON RAILS!The controls and the camera are terrible. Switching targets is harder then it should be and goes to the wrong one half the time. The combat is almost amazing but it lack little things to make it fun like an indicator when an enemy outside the terrible camera view is about to melee attack you. Also the enemies seem to have godlike tracking ability to the point you cant roll out of the way of a spell unless you are rolling toward the rear of the enemy and that is just because they cant turn fast enough to track you. Maybe I want to be a nimble wizard and take skills \"that dont exist\" to give me bonuses in evading while rolling.....IDK LIKE AN RPG!The biggest issue by far is the lack of feeling like you are in school. I dont even get to answer the riddle to get into the Raven Claw commons! I should have to do it every time unless I use the flu. How hard is it to make dialog for a door that is only riddles, when the game already has a dialog system? There is no going to class mini games, there is no building relationship with teachers and being a brown nose. You will never have a bully or develop relationships with other kids and the houses. The most interactive it gets is spinning some globes that are everywhere. All the thing that make a magic high school magical are not here! I mean Fable a game from the 2000 had a system where you could form a relationship with every NPC in the game. I wanted to make my own friend group develop rivalries and actually compete in the house cup.This is a cash grab plain and simple! It sadly does nothing great, it lacks the feeling of truly being at Hogwarts, and immersion into this world apart from spinning some globes. It sacrifices depth of gameplay for wow factor and graphic. Of which are not even that good either. So what was the trade off? Why not just down grade the visuals and increase the gameplay depth? These are rhetorical question, yes the graphic should have been down graded and content expanded.Its like one of those movie DC or Marvel universe games with a bit more choice. So get it on sale for $39.99 $49.99It does have a great attention to lore detail.

I\\'d say the actual weakest part of the game is the actual gameplay, although it is entertaining enough to carry itself.  Most of the enjoyment I\\'ve had so far has been from exploration, which is something I look forward to in everything I play.The character customization is not what I\\'d consider good, although it\\'s probably acceptable for most.  There seems to be a wide variety of different clothing options that you find regularly, and (having tested on two different saves) the loot is randomized.  The shaders on the hair are absolutely awful, and despite spending quite a while sifting through them and looking at them in different lighting environments, never found anything that looked good.  There seems to be something... wrong with many of the faces and eyes, particularly the girls, to me.The story (which I am not far into) seems intriguing enough, typical fantasy spiel, as you might imagine for the genre.  Many of the character voices are somewhat unusual, even jarring, at times.  When not over-acting, there\\'s a serious \"robotic\" voice / pitch issue for both the player character and NPCs at times.  The lip syncing is quite unnatural and distracted me at times, as well as the strange empty eyes that most NPCs have.The combat is what I\\'d consider \"rock, paper, scissors\" combat.  You need to cast the right type of spell, generally noted by its colour, to break certain defenses which also share the colour of the spell type that must break them.  While it is not difficult even on hard difficulty, it can be very fast-paced and reaction-heavy when fighting multiple enemies.  That alone makes the combat pretty engaging, but there is no real depth or complexity I can note beyond this.This title is certainly not worth the listing price and if you are dead set on getting it, wait for sales... or perhaps pursue a more morally acceptable avenue of acquisition.  I can certainly see it becoming a micro-transaction hell in the future.It is not a terrible game and is more good than bad, on those terms.  Nostalgia will certainly be a winning factor for many fans of the series, and I suspect that is a large catalyst for its seemingly overall success.  Suffice to say, the thick controversy over this title does it absolutely no favours.  The way some of the more sensitive subjects are handled in-game feels like something between a haphazardly forced afterthought and a poor joke that leaves the entire room uncomfortable.  The more I progress through the game, the more I find myself thinking these instances were not mistakes.Speaking purely from a reviewer\\'s standpoint on a game, I cannot see it being worth the price.  It\\'s not ground-breaking, it\\'s not amazing, and does nothing new for the open world genre.  It\\'s not terrible, but it\\'s not \"overwhelmingly\" and \"positively\" good, to me, at least.  As it stands now I cannot really recommend it, especially concerning the price and what you get for the content, not counting moral / ethical reasons.I\\'m sure nobody has come to the review section to hear my personal feelings on the controversies involved, so all I\\'ll say is:Some of the behaviors I have seen absolutely disgust me.

This is a hot take, but 2002 Chamber of Secrets game offers better castle exploration, as every secret is unique and based around clever use of spells learned. Here its find 16 keys, solve 10 math riddles, light up 20 statues - repeat ad nauseum. The castle itself doesn\\'t feel large because of that. Maybe it is - but it\\'s empty for the most part. There are some inspired puzzles like freezing the fireplace in the library to get access behind it - but those are unfortunately few and far between. And this criticism basically extends to every part of the game. Every village has a quest \"give NPC a potion and get 3 other potions as a reward\". Alohomora comes with a needless lockpicking minigame which you\\'ll quickly grow to hate. It\\'s like they were using every trick in the book to extend playtime.Another weak point is role playing. A single ending set in stone and a single line of behavior - the fullest extent of you trying to be a villain is asking to be paid for a quest. While you can learn Unforgivable Curses they feel shoehorned in as nobody cares about you using them. It\\'s actually comical to hear the protagonist comment about getting rid the wizarding world of bad poachers who hurt puppies - right after torturing them with Crucio. Even though you can say you want the power for yourself at the end of the story - it simply does not go anywhere.They tried to make every house a distinct experience, and it\\'s nice to hear \"you\\'re an asset to Slytherin\" from NPC  and a few similar house-specific comments, but, again - there\\'s but a few of those scattered throughout the game.I like a lot of things about the game, it\\'s beautiful and combat is really cool, but for the most part it feels like more work went into fancy decorations than filling them with substance.

Currently I am enjoying the dark arts arena, and can see me playing this loads in the future (exclusive with deluxe edition). The choices you make do feel like they make an impact, its truly a great game, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is hesitant.This is not to say the game is without technical issues though, I find myself often having to restart to resolve some odd stutter issue, which is very disorienting, and not a dev myself, but it seems likely related to a memory leak or shader caching, and I hope it can be fixed. This does interrupt the game play experience, and keeps this game from a 9-10/10, which it very well could be, if the technical issues on PC are addressed.TLDR; The story, combat, and visuals all combine to immerse you in this wonderful world, the best game this year (IMO), technical issues hold it back but otherwise 7.5/10EDIT: The game has become nearly unplayable with recent updates to both the game and AMD drivers, both updates were supposed to fix performance, not make it worse.

There are a myriad of outfits and cosmetic options in the game but all of them feel out of place. Every single student is dressed nearly identically but you can walk in looking like a Scottish Monster Hunter and its so bizarre I don\\'t even understand the reason for it beyond just having options that don\\'t really mean anything. Exploring rewards nothing but generic God of War style looter shooter gear that you slot the bigger number in. And with how slow and monotonous opening the menus are, it quickly becomes a chore you won\\'t want to even bother with. I was originally intending to do a breakdown of which individual components are bad about the game, that was until I realized... Everything was pretty terrible in some way. Menus are clunky, numerous and filled with needless animations that bloat the time you spend navigating important menus such as quests and challenges, all super immersion breaking, but placed within an idea of a magical book your character is handed. Why not just make it a real book that doesn\\'t take you out of the experience? The map is awful to navigate, it seems like it would benefit from a top down view, but instead you get an awkward side angle that gives you no real depth or perspective on what you\\'re zooming in on. Combat is dull, its just a color match game of purple shield means use purple spell, red shield means use red spell, orange circle means block, red circle means dodge. Its shitty God of War with such a small selection of spells, most of which are useless and the majority of which are unlocked through tedious side content that has no meaning, impact or interest. Drink 3 potions to unlock X spell. You get the idea. Where is the promised deep spell combo customization? Fucking spamming is more effective for most enemies since they die fairly quickly with 0 challenge. The only difficulty coming from how annoyingly binded the dodge key is initially to actually avoid red circle attacks. Its very pretty I\\'ll give it that, but it has the depth of a puddle. Flying is fine, but that\\'s all you can say, its barebones, stiff and feels straight of a modern MMO than a singleplayer RPG The narrative is horrifically terrible. With a predictable, uninteresting story surrounding characters with 0 compelling traits or motives. Which is kind of disappointing when you consider how interesting the opening of the game was, only for it to be immediately explained via obvious contextual clues the characters spend 10 hours contemplating when you\\'ve already figured it out based on the obvious. I hope you enjoy almost every enemy having the exact same 3 voice actors, no personality, and just a complete lack of any motivation to actually fight anyone besides being told to fight X amount of people for a challenge in the dumb magic book. There is nothing to discover or earn besides more shit pointless loot that will be replaced within an hour anyway. The puzzles are similarly serviceable but uninteresting, boiling down to just pressing the right spell on the right widget. Is Hogwarts Legacy transphobic? I don\\'t care. Its just a bad game. Pretending like you\\'re owning the libs by buying it ain\\'t that impressive chief, considering you\\'re funding libs by doing it. And for the other camp, JK Rowling is already wealthier than Harry Potter at the start of the series, forwarding her transphobic agenda isn\\'t hinging on the sales of Hogwash LegassFundamentally, I think the question is whether Hogwarts Legacy is a bad game, and my simple response is, Hogwarts Legacy is a game completely bathed in mediocre corporate product. It has nary a sliver of artistic vision, and presents a world I understand many people love in the most derivative, pandering and generic fashion that I find it to be the greatest weapon against Dementors with how devoid of soul it is.Edit: After fully completing the main story, I have absolutely no revisions to add except that the story is even worse than I had imagined. I held pointless hope that it would at least try and have some nuance in its storytelling but I got exactly what I knew in the recesses of my mind I would. A narrative so devoid of significance, consequence, or even basic thematic qualities that punctuate any good story, that I genuinely feel anger at the conclusion for being so completely watered down into nothingness.

There is no single choice which matters, no single character to actually care about (except perhaps Sirona for some, obviously ;-)) and no story you\\'ll remember.Neither any twist or reputation. Cast Avada Kedavra or not, be an ass or not, the world could not care less - or perhaps backfire at some point. It\\'s a typical console-based, triple A mainstream product with all that eye-candy glitter but no depth or any memorable moments at all.Thanks to the sheer amount of resources put into the development \"they\" may be worth to kill one evening\\'s time once it goes on sale but before that happens do yourself a favor and go play some ancient Bioware/CDPR game instead. One unexpected Leliana\\'s song at the campfire beats all that soulless raytracing for which you\\'ll need a $5000 machine to actually enjoy it anyway.But alright, if you don\\'t mind being addressed by NPCs as \"they\" then you can consider my recommendation \"neutral\".

After installing it took me a whole day to even get it running for the first time. I kept getting crashes, stuck in loading screens, graphics bugs in game, yes, even freezing up my PC and crashing my graphics card. After trying out several solutions I found on the internet and setting it to the lowest graphics settings possible while running it in compatibility mode I finally managed to get it at least running. To be clear, I am running the game on a high end PC... Now after playing a few hours the game just keeps crashing randomly in cutscenes and loading it up can take anything from 15 minutes up to 3+ hours - if it decides to run at all. At the moment it is impossible for me to play as the game doesn't even start anymore  - I didn't change a single setting, neither in the game nor on steam nor on my PC.TLDR Anyone who wants to play this game - wait until the devs have fixed the technical issues.

The main story is about you are the main protagonist that is a special person where the world literally revolves around you. Everyone will like you instantly. In the game each quest will give you two options good or bad which will determine how people react with you.The combat revolves around parrying and matching colours of your spells to attack enemies Making every encounter more complex as you go along. Doing combos will allow you to do an ultimate attack eventually which does massive damage and can kill most enemies. Doing more quests will unlock more mechanics and spells. Levelling in this game is pretty interesting as it is either by doing collectables or focusing on eliminating enemies from combat. I reached level 20 (max level 40) just from collecting most of the collectables in Hogwarts. Levels give increased health points, talents (which you unlock later in the story) and better gear that all the enemies level towards. Unfortunately, on a RTX 3080 the game requires me to be at medium if playing at 2k Quality... Game tends to be extremely choppy at times when on a higher quality. The default quality that the game assigned me with originally was Ultra on all. Causing the frame rate to crawl to snails pace during the original cutscenes.At this current time. I have mixed feeling about the game. For an exploration open world game it is brilliant but finding out that you have to do force stealth sections to complete everything is kind of annoying. You have puzzles to do math in a stealth section...If you like Harry Potter this game is definitely for you.

Crashes every time I try to. Specs aren\\'t the problem, drivers are neither. Reinstalled it, started it with low and with high details. Just doesn\\'t start. Dunno why I thought that preordering would be a good idea. Guess I just wanted to regain faith into developers.= Update =Alright, got it working. The shader compilation on startup causes the crashes. There\\'s a mod on nexusmods that disables this compilation and makes it start normally. So: I can play it now. But the fact that you need a mod for the game to even run in the first place, is still a joke.The performance is also pretty nasty. 60% of the time it\\'s smooth and the rest is either 20-30 FPS or sometimes even 1-5 FPS. That shouldn\\'t be happening for a finished game. But well, who releases finished games nowadays anyway?Here are the things that really bother me besides performance1) There is absolutely no house rivalty. Your house doesn\\'t even matter. You\\'re just super good friends with everyone. I know that the game wants to appeal to everyone but come on. Why can\\'t there be some rivalty between the houses - especially when quidditch isn\\'t even a thing - what\\'s a joke on itself btw.2) You as the main character have as much of a personality as a wet slice of toast. The \"choices\" you get don\\'t change anything. Even when you choose the - assumed - nasty ones you\\'re still super nice. And yeah, it\\'s kinda the same point than before but why do I have to be such a nice guy? There might be - and definetely are - characters I can\\'t stand. But I still am forced to be nice to them.3) The game is woke. And it sucks. Call me racist but how the hell is this game far more diverse in the late 1800s than the Harry Potter story in the late 1900s. Are the non-whites just getting banned in the following century or something? Then - of course - there\\'s a trans person. Because J.K. Rowling is so mean and doesn\\'t like trans people, so - of course - they had to add one. That trans wasn\\'t a thing in the late 1800s doesn\\'t matter (sames for diversity btw). Because wizards I guess. And by the way: J.K. Rowling isn\\'t a bad person. Like not at all. All her takes defend women rights and in my humble male opinion they\\'re pretty damn justified. But oh boy, the wokies cry out loud. And while I can understand that the developers want to make as much money as they can while pleasing as many people as they can, it\\'s just not worth to throw all your values away for it. So yeah. There\\'s that. Besides that, here are some positive things I like:1) The graphics are fine (when it\\'s not lagging)2) The fighting is super fun - no complaints whatsoever3) The German voice over is fine too4) The details in the world are hilarious. Armors humming and beating eachother up, students doing magical stuff or weird corridors, paintings and objects all over the place. I really enjoy walking through hogwarts without fast travelling at all because it\\'s just so nice.5) The outfits look okay for the most part. I really enjoy the late 1800s theme.And yeah. That\\'s all I have to say about it for now.

The options for customization are limited and do not allow players to fully express their creativity. This is especially disappointing given the open-world nature of the game, as players expect more freedom to personalize their experience. Additionally, the character creator is one of the key elements that help players immerse themselves in the game world and feel connected to their avatar, but in this case, it fails to deliver. Overall, the underdeveloped character creator is a missed opportunity and a letdown for players who value customization in their gaming experiences.***Additionally, the lack of a morality system or similar gameplay mechanic is a missed opportunity. The absence of any meaningful romance options is also a letdown. **While the inclusion of Quidditch would have been a great addition, I suspect that either it was not implemented due to time constraints or will be added as a DLC to further monetize the game.***Nothing special in regard of interaction with npc and world.'], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: mmmmmmmm frog'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Haha, funnie little mage shoot light out of stick'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Avalanche clearly put a lot of love and care into this game and it shows at every step.

I have to run this game on ALL LOW settings, as well as forcing the game into fullscreen (because its not an option in game) and it still stutters, a lot. mostly during combat and moving into a new area. That said even on low settings the game is beautiful. The story is engaging, the characters are wonderful, and the combat is fun (when its not stuttering worse than Joe Biden).The open world is fantastic, and MASSIVE. While in Hogwarts i don't think i've seen or found a single door that isnt openable. some of them are locked, which i assume i will get an unlock spell eventually, or locked via a puzzle. I foresee putting many many many hours into this game just exploring. To end, I do recommend this game if you have an absolute beast of a PC, or you're willing to troubleshoot why it's stuttering (just google how to force steam games into full screen) And forget you people saying to boycott this game. Just being JKR isn't a great person doesn't mean you need to condemn the team that made this wonderful game. you can tell they were passionate about it, and they did good (hopefully performance will improve with patches) BUT for the sake of the review i will be setting it as negative, will change it if performance improvements come.\"], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: top e nem sou fa do harry'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': [\"sst2 sentence: It's Hogwarts!\"], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Now do Middle-earth Legacy'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: One of the best games I have ever played.

You can go around casting spells, no one will even look at you or react the slightest. You can go and enter people\\'s house after forcing their locks, go through their chests, they won\\'t say or do a thing, they just act like you\\'re not even there. Most of the time you can\\'t jump to places, invisible walls everywhere, making exploration very linear and flavorless. Combat is fun, but I\\'m still looking for difficulty. Basically entered one of the most dangerous places, the Forbidden Forest, after 2 hours playing and defeated everything that came my way without breaking a sweat, there is no real danger or even sense of danger, and of course you can\\'t attack centors, because yeah... you\\'re not a bad person, so the game won\\'t let you do bad things. You can fly on a broom, and again, it\\'s slow, no sensation or feeling of speed, you can go into an obstacle at full speed and you will just stop, no impact, no animation, nothing. You just stop like it\\'s okay to ram into a wall. The only decent thing about the game so far is the story. It\\'s well designed, for now, but there is not much choices or decisions to take, and the only few really don\\'t change anything to the story... you just go with it and follow the game\\'s lead. It\\'s basically a playable cinematic.So to sum it up, it is yet again a very expensive game that brings nothing new to the table, with empty promises and seemingly half finished features.

However, the more I play this game, more disappointed I become. Review is not final as I\\'m yet to finish this game, I\\'ll update it once I\\'m done with it. Now, let\\'s begin.GOOD sides.1) Environment - very well re-created world of Hogwartz and its surroundings, beautiful landscapes, place is massive, enjoyable to explore. There\\'s a certain focus of attention to details that\\'s been put when creating locations, including funny scenes and moments like two statues slamming each other every time you pass them.2) Music - Love it. Gorgeous music (Except one in Hogsmeade), it perfectly transfers those vibes from HP1-2 games and movies. Very well done.That\\'s really it, at least so far for me. Now, bad sides. There\\'s plenty and I don\\'t care about what others may say, it\\'s my personal taste and belief.BAD sides.1) Boring premise of the main story - yet another \"you\\'re a wizard\" moment where you\\'re that rare kid with super powers that very few others have. I wish it was more grounded with you being a regular student who got him/herself into trouble with friends and now are trying to solve things you may have ruined to begin with. 2) \"Loading doors\" - they ruin immersion for me even if the game is installed on SSD but there are a few moments when I can\\'t enter a different location for a few seconds as the location itself is being loaded and thus the door won\\'t open right away. A minor annoyance. 3) Hogsmeade music.4) CHARACTERS. Oh god, why. Game is set in 1800s, it\\'s pre-Victorian era. Yet we have characters from other, far away eastern or/and southern countries. Transgender characters. Lesbian characters. Etc, etc, etc. If you want to make a game that follows nowadays trends, do a setup in 2010s+ year, not in 1800s. Otherwise it completely obliterates all that magical charm that the environment tries to establish by having modern trends clash against it. Absolute waste.5) Cutscenes. Feels very rushed. Some cutscenes are short, some characters reply without any expression or care. Classes last for a few minutes and it\\'s always you doing things. Learn a spell. Click click. Voila, class is over lads. It feels that devs put a lot of effort in re-creating the environment and then they were told: \"Yo, you have 1 month to release the game\". 6) RPG Elements. It\\'s good to have a variety of items to wear but they also grant you offensive and defensive attributes which force you to constantly \"upgrade\" your gear. Not to mention that your inventory is limited to 20 items, which is very small. I\\'d rather have the game make us think and become creative with spells rather than \"brute force\" your enemies instead. Complete miss on this one imo.7) Camera angle central pivot point is too low. If you make a perfect horizontal view, it\\'ll be on a belly level rather than shoulder level. So when you begin to look around, your own character takes plenty of screen space. 8) Some technical glitches with shading, texture buffering being too slow.9) My character loves to lock his head left or right when running around rather than look where he runs to.10) You have a large variety of spells but you can only have 4 active ones at the time with 1-2-3-4 keys and (at least) I haven\\'t figured out how to add more to the active slots. 11) Whole UI feels like the game was designed for the consoles but was ported to PCs. It\\'s not that bad but its that evident. 12) Population - while the game has day/night cycle, I don\\'t see students & teachers going to their beds in the evening. Location \"despawns\" populus behind your back. You can be semi-afk staring at a beautiful painting playing a nice melody and suddenly, location is empty because its night. You look around once more, its full again as its morning. But you don\\'t see them coming downstairs or upstairs, they just appear. Its this odd feeling when world is sort of alive but it isnt.

The RPG side is a little thin, in that there are many NPC's and objects in the environment you can't interact with or affect, and so far it's been nothing but fetch quests. You'll quickly notice very repetitive animations from the NPCs  & objects, very repetitive ambient dialogue, and some rushed looking set design. When it comes to the sets, it's either repetitive patterns in object placement, or the place feels empty like it was supposed to be an MMO. For example the hallways feel oversized and empty in the same way that starship corridors in Star trek online don't really feel like you're in the tv-show. These all add up to break the immersion a bit, which if we're all honest with ourselves is the main point in buying it. If you're looking for a nice magical RPG and don't give a shit about the HP stuff, there are plenty of other games out there that do something more interesting.There are two parts where it gets awful; 1st; performance and 2nd; keyboard and mouse input.  My computer isn't the newest, but it's no potato. Running this on an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X processor, paired with 32 GB ram and an RTX 2080 Ti (even with RTX settings at low) it's an unplayable mess in busy areas almost as soon as you're out of the tutorial: npcs disappearing in and out of existence, frame rate crawling into single digits, textures loading slowly, constant stuttering.When it comes to interacting with keyboard and mouse it's clear from the very first spell you learn that the game wasn't intended to be played with a keyboard or mouse, no 'challenge' to learning at all and it doesn't get any better after that, it feels like mashing the keyboard during combat like some sort of court stenographer, just not in a fun way. Play it with controller for how the game was meant to be 'enjoyed'.   Overall a solid meh/10. Ignore the hype and curated reviews. It's a shame as I loved the HP series as a kid and hoped for something a little more like the books and movies.

They range from puzzles to fetching things from actually fleshed out sidequests. The sidequests especially are a great way to discover the castle and its surroundings. The customization to your character is a nice touch, but is not that big of a deal (which is fine). There's lots of clothing you can put on and the character creation menus are big enough to make the character YOURS, without too many options to go through. Graphics are obviously great and way better than I expected when the game was first released. The castle looks amazing, is large and is a huge maze (which is good) to discover and explore. And the other areas look really great too!This is seriously a childhood dream come true! We're finally able to explore Hogwarts and its surroundings without having the Harry Potter story locked to it and get to create our own adventure! I love the fact that there's only certain links to the original seven books without pushing another HP narrative down our throats and really creating a new story within the lore. That said... there's also bad stuff...[b]The Bad and The Ugly[/b]The game is a big 50/50 for me right now. Bad things first. I went into this expecting another bad release on PC (especially since it's ported from PS5 to PC). And sadly, the early reviews were right about performance. There are more stories that are bad than good, ranging from crashes before even starting with the game to massive FPS drops. The opening of the game seemed fine, with stable 75 fps (locked), but once I got into Hogwarts castle, there were massive drops to around 20 fps (especially around staircases?). And some cutscenes (especially with more than one NPC in it) were even worse. GPU's seem to be the culprit of this as it goes all the way up to 100% the moment it dips to low fps. Another bad thing (which is personal preference) is voice acting. I believe it's all over the place. Profsesor Ronen and Natty sound amazing, but other characters - including yourself - sound generic and slightly emotionless. This won't be fixed in any update, just pointing it out. A third thing - which I was afraid of by watching the trailers - is combat. When fighting enemies it feels like you're just randomly firing your wand at targets for 90% of the time. Would've expected a little more from this, considering wand combat is a major part in the franchise. Last: Spiders. Why can't developers (expect for those that made Grounded) put in a Arachnophobia mode. Every. Single. Game. All the time they have to put these horrible creatures in there. For once, please consider it for those with the phobia because it really breaks the motivation to play these games. [b]Verdict[/b]Was this game worth the pre-order and 10 bucks more? No, definitely not. The performance issues really break the immersion. I usually don't pre-order games (due to this exact reason), but was way too hyped for this game. Bad mistake. For some reason, developers just screw PC releases almost all the time. I get it, they can't test it on every single combination of hardware, but I had hopes they learned from the Cyberpunk release. It's not THAT bad, but the performance is bad too often currently. Will ths game be worth it on release (10th of February)? If you're reading this before buying, make sure either the development team has released an update adressing and FIXING the performance issues - or Nvidia has release their driver updates to fix the issues. If they haven't, consider waiting a little longer before the performance issues are fixed (or buy it on PS5/XBOX if you have that option, want to play instantly and don't care for future mods, etc.) For now, I'll have to downvote this game due to performance, but I'll definitely recommend the game if they sort that out!Edit 1: Day 1 patch (if we can even call 300 MB that...) does not seem to fix the performance issues.Edit 2: Second patch (14-02) didn't fix anything about the performance, even though they stated in the patch notes that it should have solves some issues.\"], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: 10/10 except for hogsmeade.

Game have some basic raytracing and it's an buggy mess, which causes more crashing issues (not the RTX, RTX is buggy mess aswell).

A lot of assets are not done in the same style which makes some things feel disjointed. Its almost like they didnt have much of an art direction and each artist did as they pleased. The character creator has barely any options and its mainly presets. It is also unoptimised with a lot of stuttering and FPS drops and there are loading screens basically everywhere and asset pop-in even when installed on an NVMe SSD. There are some bugs as well, more noticeably voice pitch changes sound like a robot.There are some good things like the music and character design. Every NPC is voice acted with some fairly decent actors. The lightning and atmosphere is done really well and also its just really cool to move around the wizarding world and see such a large part of it.Overall I'm fairly disappointed.

It's just par for the course these days with big releases that multi-platform games are just going to be straight up doodoo on the PC until a few patches in.Secondly, if you really love the lore / world of Harry Potter, then I'm sure you'll be able to look past many of the faults this game has and enjoy it. Personally, I've always thought the books were quite clearly children's books, not particularly well written, and that a lot of the love for the franchise appears to come from the films. The films did a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of designing this game, from the appearance of the titular castle to the familiar score.If, however, you're approaching this game from a point of neutrality or are somehow relatively in the dark about the HP mythos, then prepare for disappointment. Graphically it's fine. Some of the interiors are actually incredibly detailed and well put together, but the character models and faces all look like putty and are all incredibly similar to one another. The sound effects and music are quite good, but the voice acting is bad and the quality of it is often laughable, especially when some of the delivery is audibly causing the microphone to peak but they apparently decided to just stick with it regardless. Special shout-out to the voice pitch in character creation, where choosing anything other than the detail results in your character sounding like a broken robot.Quests are fairly varied, but if you're hoping for the sort of school experience you'd get from a Persona game (or even Bully) or the breadth of character interactions from the Witcher 3, RDR2 or other similar open world games, you will again be left feeling let down. There's a lot of Ubisoft style collect-a-thon to do, but the only rewards are cosmetic, of which only a handful actually look good. Combat is snappy and visually appealing but incredibly repetitive after only a few hours in.This is the very definition of a 5/10 game. For everything it does well, it either does something else poorly or is missing what you'd hope from a big title. It is certainly not worth the price tag.

Enjoyable writing, fun gameplay and a very immersive world.Only downside is the lack of student interaction. I hope they fix it with some dlc down the line.Thank you based J.K. Rowling.\"], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: No spoilers contained.Although, this game more than any, is about the journey, not the end. The end is irrelevant, if not entirely predictable.It\\'s wonderful to finally experience Hogwarts in all its glory. They promised you could explore every room, and you can (if you have the right spell or skill with Arithmancy).The castle is a technical and artistic marvel - the designers and developers must be praised for their effort. There\\'s never been a more expertly executed interior space. The amount of in-game clutter produced is astounding.It truly is a 1:1 scale Hogwarts.But RPGs rely on story as well.The game story unfolds at a consistent pace, though the story itself is quite mid. I suppose what helps is that it\\'s quite short.The world is also quite small (those leaks earlier about the potential game map size were utterly false)If you\\'re looking for a Hogwarts Simulator, you\\'ve got the wrong mind set. Think of each class as a Main Story quest - one you\\'ll attend once. You wont be able to sit down in chairs, or stone rails, or steps. You wont be able to lay down in bed or emote. There\\'s not even a sleep mechanic.In fact, it\\'ll feel weird and out of place and creepy as you freely running around Hogwarts at night, with no Prefects or Teachers, Ghosts or Poltergeists to stop you with no story-driven reason that excuses you. Yet, wonder why no students are in the Common Rooms at night, nor asleep in their beds. It\\'s very unsettling.You can also enter and leave the castle at will. You can see teachers in their class at night, as they stand there and busy themselves with looped animation cycles.Once you enter the restricted area, you\\'re free to do so (with no story-driven explanation for this). And yes, while you can\\'t enter other Common Rooms, you\\'ll only experience the magic of entering the room (giving a password, striking the right barrel, or answering the riddle), once upon the first entry, and it never comes up again.Any other time you attend class, it\\'ll be to an empty room, or a random, brief cut-scene with no dialogue. Additional \"lessons\" are nothing more than a short fetch question or duel delivered to you via in-game mail with a robotic-like voice over.Not that any of this is necessarily bad, but I\\'m just trying to set the right expectations for this: this is NOT a Hogwarts simulator. It\\'s an action RPG with a short and tight story, some repetetive story quests, and a relatively small map.The main character you play is also quite generic - just polite, no matter what dialogue choice you pick (which, unfortunately, doesn\\'t impact the story), and accommodating. It\\'s almost as though the only reason there\\'s multiple dialogue options is because they had extra voice over lines sitting around.Maybe the generic MC was a design choice, so you could live vicariously through the character - but it really has the opposite effect. It pulls you out of the game.Paired with the jarring and very robotic-sounding voice-over audio, it almost feels like you\\'re playing a generic, AI generated NPC who\\'s just being controlled by your mouse and keyboard.Maybe in a future game, they\\'ll give the character more personality (better yet, make us a teacher with a background).As far as variety, there\\'s about 52 main quests in Hogwarts Legacy, but these aren\\'t very big or long. Most of them are about 2-5 minutes, with a few (that take you through a dungeon), a tad longer.There\\'s about 5 different potions to brew, and just as many as plants usable for battle, and 16 different ingredients to craft with - which you don\\'t have to work very hard to obtain.There\\'s only 4 different crafting tables, and just about everything is made using the same resource. But there\\'s a nice visual variety to them, and they can be colorized.The first 5 hours of the game will be like the other 35 you\\'ll expected to take to complete the game. You can extend your play time by walking to locations instead of using the Floo-network, which I\\'m sure you\\'ll do.That said, I now have to unfortunately talk about performance. Which is the reason why I can\\'t recommend this game in its current state.My specs:- Gigabyte Gaming OC GeForce 4090- Intel i9-10900k (3.7 GHz) processor- 64GB of DDR4-3600 memory- The game is installed on an M.2 NVMEBut it runs like trash once you get into the main game.The first hour is highly optimized - but once the world opens and you\\'re free to explore Hogwarts, your system will be brought to its knees.The largest culprit appears to be a memory leak, one that\\'s even worse at Hogsmead.The longer you play, the worse it gets.The game, in its state, reaches a frustrating point that\\'ll require you to stop moving and sit there for a second while shaders compile.Characters will begin to pop in and out. Loading times for rooms increase. And frames drop down to 20 FPS (with my hardware, anyways), even with DLSS and Ray Tracing turned down to low or disabled entirely. RT is broken, but the game remains broken even with RT off.There\\'s Denuvo\\'s in there, so that\\'s likely the biggest issue with the performance.If you\\'re worried about performance, just wait for it to go on sale.Or for more patches to release - but in my years of gaming experience, these types of issues can take a year to resolve, and throwing good money at bad performance provides no incentive for game developers to fix anything.- I\\'ve installed the \"Day 1\" patch- I\\'ve installed the \"Game Ready\" drivers by NVIDIA- Don\\'t forget to re-disable RT options after installing the driver updateI\\'ll gladly update this review if performance improves, but right now, today\\'s not that day.Note: If you\\'ve installed the Game Ready drivers and are experiencing intense stuttering at the Character Select screen, check your RT settingsThey were likely re-enabled. Display settings will have also changed (it\\'ll turn on Frame Generation - itself rife with artifacting)Also, don\\'t forget, you\\'re paying for a game that\\'s been drawn and quartered. There are Play-Station exclusive quests and gear that you will have to wait a year to receive.Several in-game items have also been stripped away, instead requiring you to watch Twitch Streams (which, if you didn\\'t watch the Launch stream today, then you wont receive at all).But good job adding all those cats. If surely only to get some random cookie-cutter streamer out there to say \"Gotta pet all the cats\" in the cringest way possible (there\\'s no achievement for that, is there?)Personal tip: to extend your enjoyment out of this rather short game, don\\'t do as others recommend and rush through the game until you get the spell alohomora.Instead, each opportunity you\\'re given, explore as much of the castle as you can. Each time you learn a new spell, try going through each room and finding new puzzles you can solve. If you wait until you have alohamora, you\\'ll be able to do a clean-sweep of each room and have no reason to return, shortening the life and destroying the sense of discoverability.At the end of the day, Hogwarts, while big, isn\\'t infinite. And if you end up walking into a room with all 3 or 4 skills to unlock everything, there wont be a reason to return to the room.If you do what I say, you\\'ll revisit each room a number of times and really let you feel like you\\'re spending a full school year there.'], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Better then I expected!

If a patch to fix the game isn't released within a week I'll be requesting a refund because the game straight up doesn't work, I've never done so before but releasing a game in this state is unacceptable.I would really like to recommend this game, but due to it's horrible performance I can't do so at this time and I'd highly suggest waiting until it's been patched. The game was clearly made for consoles because the optimisation on PC is awful and the game barely works because of it, which is very unfortunate because the game seems like it's great. It's obviously had a lot of love put into it and the gameplay is very good, but it runs so poorly that it's literally unplayable in it's current state. My PC is more than capable of running this game on the highest settings with 60+ FPS, but it constantly stutters which causes the FPS to drop dramatically and I've seen drops into the single digits; for comparison, I can run RDR2 and MW2 on maximum settings without any issues but I can't run HL even on the lowest settings.The game looks great, the dialogue and voice acting is very good, the setting is cool and Hogwarts itself is extremely well made, with fun combat that exceeded my expectations. However I've barely been able to play it because it performs so poorly, which is very disappointing.

Broom? Nothing.... That's not a normal open world experience.8) The game is open world but leashes you to NPC's during the opening act making it impossible to explore until you are finally given freedom from ur chores.

Everything on low with dlss only gives 8 fps in hogsmeade.At this point, the games performance is absolutely horrible, there are weird things at play between the GPU, memory, and CPU.  I have been enjoying the game, I was skeptical but it does a good enough job and I will be finishing it for sure. I have: CPU:  R7-5800xMemory: 32 GB (3600)GPU: 3080-Tistorage: Samsung 970 Evo Plus. Like reviews online, the prologue mission runs well (no bugs) but once you hit Hogwarts the performance tanks dramatically. Before Hogwarts:2k Ultra + Ultra raytracing: 50-60 fps 2k Ultra + Ultra raytracing + DLSS quality: around 85 fps2k Ultra + ultra raytracing + DLSS balanced: just over 100 fps. After Hogwarts:The 3080-TI runs at 12GB VRAM always, i have dropped settings down to low and it still uses that much memory. On top of that, running at 2k ultra + ray tracing can use as much as 17 GB system memory on top of the VRAM. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As hardware unboxed pointed out, the CPU never reaches more than 55% for any given thread and uses roughly 15-40% CPU depending on DLSS level, no DLSS is lower CPU usage. I have encountered areas where I run at 50 FPS and the CPU is using 20% and the GPU is at 65% usage, this is typically with some sort of DLSS active. The setting I personally use at the moment to play which can roughly maintain 40fps or higher, but can dip while loading a new zone occasionally.Effects quality: UltraMaterial quality: High Fog quality: MediumSky quality: MediumFoliage quality: MediumPost processing: Low         (any works as I don't use depth of field or such effects)Shadows: UltraTextures: Medium            (can't run Hogwarts any higher, outside Hogwarts ultra)View distance: Ultra         (dropping setting  did not increase any fps)Population: Ultra              (dropping setting  did not increase any fps)Ray tracing: All, Ultra       (I think it adds to the game, definitely didn't put in effort to make non-ray tracing look good)DLSS: balanced               (can put on quality at times, other times frames still under 20 on quality). I hope this helps make the game playable if no drivers or patches fix these issues. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The good: -Lighting and atmosphere-Combat (tricky to master)-Tutorial: I hate tutorials, but they made it in such a way its a side thought and not the focus.-Systems, whether looting, challenges, and collectibles are implemented well. The bad: -Optimization: as noted above-Textures: not the best looking game for textures at all even with ultra (maybe performance patch will allow better processing),- Only 2 voice actors, even though you can switch tone, it does not sound natural. -Choices don't seem to matter, the following dialogue will set things straight.

Original review is still available below.The game makes a good job of looking and playing better than it is, for the first 10-15 hours. But after this, all the magic starts to wear off and its problems start to become more apparent.The world is vast, but there is nothing to do. Developers took the easiest way out and filled the world with meaningless quests which lead nowhere and with dungeons which have nothing inside but some bullshit glasses, even though the character repeats, all the time, \"I should be careful\".80% of playtime is \"pop 5 balloons\", \"pop 10 balloons\", \"pop 15 balloons\". \"Solve 10 Merlin Trials\",  \"Solve 15 Merlin Trials\",  \"Solve 20 Merlin Trials\". \"Kill 50 goblins\", \"Kill 10 trolls\" and so on. It just never ends.And I don\\'t even want to go into the moronic overall plot, with main character casting Avada Kedavra like it\\'s nothing, or \"rescuing\" beasts by selling them on the market.It is such a waste - to create this big castle with such intricate architecture and attention to details just to waste it away. Who cares about it, if most of the time is spent outside, in caves and lifeless villages?Honestly, just a few years ago I replayed the first three Harry Potter games, both PC and PS2 versions of each, in a row - and I had more fun than I did playing Hogwarts Legacy.No plot, no moral choices, no Quidditch, no proper secondary quests - nothing. At this point, I will just finish the main game and be done with it.----------After around 10 hours into the game, I think I actually got the experience which I expected, which is somehow surprising, for the first game I\\'ve ever pre-ordered. Many people were hyped for this game, and many who have already played it still are, but the truth, as always, is somewhere in between.Pros:- The setting, of course. The whole territory is just amazing to explore, and attention to details is amazing. Hogwarts does, indeed, feel like Hogwarts, The territory is huge, there is a lot to see and explore, and if it was not for the setting the game would be just mediocre, at best.- Flying on the broom, again, due to the setting, is astonishing. It is easy to control and really feels liberating. It\\'s a shame that there is no Quidditch in the game, but I am pretty sure it will be a DLC, knowing the Warner Brothers.- The music. Not much to say here - we all watched the Harry Potter movies and we all know what to expect. Let me just say that you will not be disappointed.- Casting the spells does feel powerful and engaging, as it should be.Cons (more or less):- The game really does feel dated. I have to agree with most of the official reviews in this regard. It is great to play, true, but overall it feels like a game from 2015-2017 era, with all possible advantages and problems of this time. It might be hard to explain, but I am sure that everyone who played other games from WB from this bygone era would understand me. A lot feels like playing, let\\'s say, Shadow of Mordor, even though the games overall are very different. Smaller things, like NPCs not reacting to anything or ability to simply clip into an NPC are just another reminders of the times long gone.- The biggest problem of the game being dated are the sections when you talk to NPCs. Those are amazingly hilarious. They just stand in one place, looping over the same hand gestures, smiling like idiots, and the voiceover... Damn. There are some students which do sound like complete and utter morons. Hogwarts is a school, yes, but it is not a kindergarten, and in 2023 these kinds of dialogues are just unacceptable.- You start the game with only 20 item slots for gear. This means that after a few hours you will have no more space to put new items in, so whatever chests you find in the world will not allow you to loot them. You would need to either destroy the items you have, or sell the leftovers. Why to have this in the first place is a big mystery to me, because it hurts exploration a lot for no apparent reason. You can upgrade the slots further, but it takes a lot of time, cannot be done at the early stages of the game, and moreover - you can, it seems, increase it only from 20 to 40. Why not just make it infinite? I was playing Xenoblade Chronicles recently and was able to store hundreds of items before selling them, with no inconvenience for me.- Playing the game with a keyboard is just a total mess. Too many actions are tied to the left hand, naturally, and when fighthing - it just becomes too much. The best example are controls for the auto-lock. Just think about this: you have your right hand on the mouse, left hand on the keyboard. For casting spells and evading enemies, left hand uses: W, A, S, D, 1, 2, 3, 4, Q, E, Ctrl (not counting running, jumping, throwables etc.). The auto-lock is being turned on by pressing CAPS LOCK. Does not sound so bad? Well, to switch between enemies when auto-lock is enabled, you need to use Left and Right Arrow Buttons. Good luck with that in the middle of a fight.- The performance is not that bad, in my opinion, but I still had a lot of drops on 5700 XT, from 144 to around 20 for a few seconds, in the worst cases. It might be a problem for some people, but for me it\\'s fine, I still play Wii games with 15 FPS and have fun doing it. Interestingly enough, for some reason, casting Lumos in an open area brings the game down to around 5 FPS, but I am sure that this one is just a bug which will get fixed pretty soon.- UI, at least for now, does not really help. First of all, the game uses a very generic UI approach which is reused from many, many other open-world titles. Second of all, when you actually need to go and read some specific note (do not want to give any specific example to avoid spoilers) - you have to make your way through several menu pages, go back to the game, go through the menu again, go back to the game, and so on and so forth. It definitely could be done better, but still was not the end of the world.- On a more subjective note, I can already see, after the hours I\\'ve put into the game, that there will not be any heavy moral choices there. Developers decided to play it safe, and while I can understand it (god forbid to include torture or slavery themes there - butthurting would reach new heights), I would still prefer a proper RPG similar to Knights of the Old Republic. First Harry Potter books might have been written for kids, but the magic world is not that different from ours, and it would be great to have an opportunity to explore darker themes, at least to some extent. In this game everyone is just waaaay too cheerful. I did not even see any competion between Gryffindor and Slytherin. Well, maybe next time.- Bugs :) Yes, there are bugs.

I am not trying to ruin that for anyone and I entirely understand why people love this game and are going to upvote in reviews or even get mad down in the replies. However this is not the case for everyone and plenty of others with high end systems are having problems and the game is truly impossible to experience with such horrendous stability issues. Performance problems are being spammed on their official bug tracker website, under their most popular replies on all recent twitter posts, and discussions from the community on Steam/Reddit. So downplaying it cus you want a hive-mind to circlejerk your favorite game is foolish. Ignorant comments from actual robots such as \"mUH gAmeE wORk sO uR cOmPUteR bAD\" are everywhere and completely useless to the discussion or finding out the issue/fix, these comments will be ignored and probably deleted.It is absolutely unacceptable to sell an early launch of a game as a product, make people pay more than base price, then have a large chunk of players with a massive range of specs and settings realize after the 1-2 hour tutorial when you finally get to roam around that the game is absolutely broken, unplayable, and unoptimized. If you have to wait for a patch or game ready driver then why even sell the early release of the game at all?My specs more than clear any requirement for this game as well as any others on the market, yet during cut scenes and exploring the school it is absolutely unplayable, locking my fps to 10-15 as well as slowing down my entire PC including wallpapers on my second monitor until I close the game out entirely.FULL SPECS:3080tiRyzen 9 5900x32GB of DDR4-3200 RamSSD (I have even moved the game to another SSD and I still get poor results)3440x1440 (Have tried lowering resolution as well)No, turning settings down does nothing before you comment. Turning off RT seemed to give me some extra performance temporarily however I still hit the wall of 10-15 FPS every playsession.I have also tried:Disable SMTEnable Control Flow GuardUpdating/rolling back drivers(Got the newest one from 2/8 as well)Changing to a new SSDDisabling second monitorUpdating DLSS manuallyMy review is going up negative and will stay that way until the end of time regardless of patches. It is horrible business practice to sell people a product that does not function for a large percentage of the user base. They even went the extra mile to charge people more for an early release, when the product you purchased refuses to work.

I can hear some crackling from time to time, which is usually a sample rate issue, I've encountered with other UE4 games like Hunter:CotW. I have my interface sampling at 96kHz.Other than that: The game perfectly captures the world portrayed in the movies, going for a similar style. Story is kinda meh and all the friendship characters are really not memorable, but there is a lot to explore and the castle is very well designed. The open world does appear a bit empty, but the real stars are the castle and hogsmeade anyway (at least until now).It does feel a bit stale in terms of quest design and exploration, especially in dungeon levels. However, sidequests have a very modern design approach, as in: they are very short. There is lots of busy work, but it does not get annoying, as small tasks only take up a minute or so of your time, which makes exploring, at least until now, enjoyable.Verdict: Wait for performance to be fixed, other than that: great game, even though it is a little bit shallow.(I will change my review to positive when this happens)\"], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: the lag in the early access build made it fun'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': [\"sst2 sentence: 'Yer a wizard Harry.\"], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: 10/10 would make boycotters cry again'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: For every copy of a game sold, a LGBTQ member commits Seppuku ;)Optional: Game is actually good.'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: A dream come true for Harry Potter fans, a great game for everybody else.

Now it's playable at High with Quality DLSS on. Most of the hitching issues seem to be fixed.There are still major frame drops in many, many areas of the game, and I am still getting occasional hitching. But to see such a large improvement in less than a week is encouraging.2/10 Patch:There was a small patch when the game unlocked. If anything it made my performance worse.Original Review:I just can't recommend this game in its current state. So far I love everything about the game, except for the fact that it has, without any exaggeration, the absolute worst performance I have ever experienced in any video game, ever. Not everyone is experiencing these issues, but for me the game is actually unplayable.When it comes to performance there are two major issues. First is the low frame rate. On my RTX 2080 S no amount of tweaking graphics settings could get it to run at a reasonable frame rate at 1440p, or even 1080p. The game absolutely refuses to run above 40-50 FPS unless you turn on DLSS. Fortunately DLSS Quality Mode on the game still looks good, and it can keep a fairly stable 80-100 FPS in most areas. But even with DLSS I have seen some areas, like the Owlery, that stay below 30-40 FPS. Absolutely pathetic. The developers didn't bother optimizing their game at all. They took the lazy route and hoped that DLSS would be enough to sweep their poor optimization under the rug, and it isn't enough.But the issue that moves this game from frustrating to [i]actually unplayable[/i] is the constant hitching. It just never stops. As I'm moving through the castle I am getting constant stuttering and freezing. Sometimes the game can freeze for seconds at a time. Restarting the client fixes it for a few minutes (5 minutes, max), but the problem always comes back. And the longer I play the worse it gets.And when I quit the game the client seems to hang for several minutes before it finally shuts down. This is especially frustrating when frequently restarting the client is the only way to [i]actually play it[/i].There's no excuse for how poorly this game runs.\"], 'Class': ['Negative']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: i love making cats fly'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: 10/10 WOULD AVADA KEDAVRA AGAIN'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: The combat is really amazing'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: My wand is 13 and 3/4 inches long.It is hard.'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Simply magical'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: yer a harry wizard'], 'Class': ['Positive']}, {'Text': ['sst2 sentence: Amazing in every way.

(stopped at level 20).Now I would say if you are a die hard fan of Harry Potter and are very tolerant you may find some redeeming quality with this game but for an experienced open world RPG player like myself there is nothing worth playing here.[b]I honestly cannot believe this was rated better than Forspoken by some videogame critics.[/b][spoiler]Now quick words about the controversy surrounding this game.Apparently the creator of the Harry Potter universe J. K. Rowling said a lot of controversial things about the LGBT community, so by buying this game some people may consider you indirectly support transphobic agendas.Worth noting that after receiving so much negatitivity it seems the developers decided to include a transgender character in the game.Not that it bother me that much but this type of stuff should stay away from video games.
